\section{Introduction}

% To add: Carme Gallart (2019) three-infall-ish, Kobayashi metallicity limit for SNe Ia and sub-Chandra

The two-infall model has long been proposed to explain the formation of the Milky Way's thick and thin disks. The infall history of any given region of the disk is described by two successive, exponentially declining bursts, which explain the origin of the thick and thin disks respectively.

\subsection{Summary of Two-Infall Papers}

% Summary of two-infall papers
\citet{matteucci_galactic_1989} modeled the galaxy with a two-component model, a one-zone model for the halo and concentric shell zones for the disk. They used a simple exponential gas infall (so not yet a two-infall model), where the infall timescale increased proportionally with radius. They studied cases with primordial and pre-enriched gas infall, finding that the former produces a more realistic metallicity distribution in the Solar neighborhood. Their inside-out disk evolution produced good agreement with observed abundance gradients.

\citet{chiappini_chemical_1997} presented the first two-infall model of the MW disk. They adopted an inside-out prescription for the formation of the thin disk, with the timescale of the second infall increasing linearly with radius. They assume the formation timescale of the thick disk is 1 Gyr, and the time of the second infall is 2 Gyr. They also assume a lower threshold on the gas density required for star formation, which produces a star formation hiatus at the end of the thick disk phase. They also noted the ``loop'' that appears in the \aFe--[Fe/H] relation during the thin disk phase. They mostly compare to Solar neighborhood data.

\citet{chiappini_abundance_2001} updated their model to fit the observed abundance, stellar, and gas gradients in the Milky Way disk. They find that a density threshold for star formation, making a gap in star formation between the halo and disk phases, is necessary to reproduce observational data. They argue that the details of halo formation also have a strong impact on the outer disk. No radial flows or outflows. I'm confused about their distinction between halo and thick disk, if any.

\citet{chiappini_oxygen_2003} compare model predictions of C, N, and O to Milky Way and other spiral galaxy data. They predict a very slow enrichment between the birth of the Sun and present day, which they claim is due to their adopted gas density threshold for star formation (the infall rate is low enough that the SFR oscillates from timestep to timestep).

\citet{matteucci_effect_2009} investigated different SN Ia delay time distributions using the \citep{chiappini_chemical_1997,chiappini_abundance_2001} model. They use a model for the full disk but compare only to Solar neighborhood data. They concluded that some prompt SN Ia enrichment is necessary to match observed abundance patterns.

\citet{spitoni_effects_2009} relaxed the instantaneous recycling approximation in two different ways: galactic fountains (i.e., SN ejecta are launched out of the disk and take some time to return) and metal cooling (i.e., newly-enriched hot gas takes time to cool before it can form stars). They found that fountains do not strongly affect the evolution of the $\alpha$-elements for short (few hundred Myr) timescales. The effect of a metal cooling timescale is similarly negligible if the yields are not dependent on metallicity.

\citet{spitoni_effects_2011} find that a two-infall model of the disk without gas exchange produces a radial metallicity gradient which is too shallow. They implement an inward radial gas flow on the order of $\sim0-4$ km s$^{-1}$ which varies with radius, and find that it improves agreement with the observed gradient. However, they found that a variable star formation efficiency with radius in combination with a gas density threshold for star formation could also reproduce the observed gradient without radial flows.

\citet{spitoni_effect_2015} add a simple radial migration scheme to the model of \citet{spitoni_effects_2011}. They adopt stellar velocities of $\sim 1$ km s$^{-1}$ and assume that some fixed fraction of stars born at a given radius will end up in the Solar vicinity (10\% of those born at 4 kpc and 20\% at 6 kpc). This mimics the results of previous dynamical models such as \citet{minchev_chemodynamical_2013}. They find that by including stellar migration, they are better able to reproduce the high-metallicity tail of the local metallicity distribution, and they also argue that they constrain the migration speed to $0.5 < v < 2$ km s$^{-1}$ based on this tail. Their only point of comparison with data is the local G-dwarf metallicity distribution.

\citet{grisoni_ambre_2017} argue for a ``parallel'' scenario, where the thick and thin disks form simultaneously but with very different infall timescales (0.1 and 7 Gyr, respectively). They compare their models with stellar abundances from the AMBRE sample of solar-neighborhood dwarfs. They argue that the parallel scenario can produce metal-rich high-alpha stars in situ, whereas in the two-infall scenario these stars would have to migrate from the inner disk.

\citet{palla_chemical_2020} explored radial gas flows, variable star formation efficiency of the thin disk, and the onset time of the second infall (but not the infall timescales). They find that inside-out formation (i.e., longer infall timescales in the outer disk) is not sufficient to reproduce observed abundance gradients, and that radial gas flows, possibly in combination with a radially-varying star formation law, are key. Pre-enriched infall in the inner disk ($R<8$ kpc) at the level of -0.5 dex also improves agreement with data.

% Radial gas flows
Some two-infall studies \citep[e.g.,][]{spitoni_effects_2011,palla_chemical_2020,palla_mapping_2024} implement inward radial gas flows with velocity $\sim1$ km s$^{-1}$ in order to reproduce the radial abundance gradient without Galactic outflows.

% Three-infall
Motivated by constraints on the SFH by {\it Gaia}, \citet{spitoni_beyond_2023} proposed the three-infall model, an extension with a third phase of exponential gas infall in the last few Gyr.

\citet{palla_mapping_2024} compare model predictions to abundances and ages of open clusters from the {\it Gaia}-ESO survey. They find that the two-infall model over-predicts the metallicity of the youngest clusters, a problem which is fixed by the three-infall model. A version of the three-infall model with milder dilution (mild pre-enrichment of the gas with a smaller amount of infall) compared to \citet{spitoni_beyond_2023} can simultaneously match the metalliticy of old, intermediate, and young clusters across the disk.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\todo{Copied from last paper.} We use the multi-zone GCE model tools in \vice developed by \citet{johnson_stellar_2021}. The basic setup of our models follows theirs. The disk is divided into concentric rings of width $\delta R_{\rm gal}=100$ pc. Stellar populations migrate radially under the prescription we describe in Appendix C, but each ring is otherwise described by a conventional one-zone GCE model with instantaneous mixing (see discussion in Section \ref{sec:onezone-results}). Following \citet{johnson_stellar_2021}, we do not implement radial gas flows \citep[e.g.,][]{LaceyFall1985-RadialGasFlows,BilitewskiSchonrich2012-RadialFlows}. Stellar populations are also assigned a distance from the midplane according to their age and final radius as described in Appendix C.

\todo{Copied from last paper.} We run our models with a time-step size of $\Delta t=10$ Myr up to a maximum time of $t_{\rm final}=13.2$ Gyr. Following \citet{johnson_stellar_2021}, we set \vice to form $n=8$ stellar populations per ring per time-step, and we set a maximum star-formation radius of $R_{\rm SF} = 15.5$ kpc, such that $\dot\Sigma_\star=0$ for $R_{\rm gal}>R_{\rm SF}$. The model has a full radial extent of 20 kpc, allowing a purely migrated population to arise in the outer 4.5 kpc. We adopt continuous recycling, which accounts for the time-dependent return of mass from all previous generations of stars \citep[see Equation 2 from][]{JohnsonWeinberg2020-Starbursts}. We summarize these parameters in Table \ref{tab:multizone-parameters}.

\subsection{Nucleosynthetic Yields}
\label{sec:yields}

The population-averaged nucleosynthetic yields of CCSNe are still fairly uncertain. This problem is exacerbated by the complexity of the CCSN explosion landscape \citep{sukhbold_core-collapse_2016}. Recently, \citet{weinberg_scale_2024} used a measurement of the mean Fe yield of CC SNe by \citet{rodriguez_iron_2023} and the observed \aFe plateau at low metallicity to infer population-averaged yields of $y/Z_\odot\approx1$ --- in other words, the scale of SN yields relative to the Solar abundance is of order unity.
% This problem is exacerbated by the complexity of the CCSN explosion landscape \citep{sukhbold_core-collapse_2016}. We adopt the yields of \citet{weinberg_scale_2023}, who use a measurement of the mean Fe yield of CC SNe by \citet{rodriguez_iron_2023} and the observed \aFe plateau to infer population-averaged yields. The only difference here is that we assume that $20\%$ of Si in the Sun is produced by SNe Ia, which reduces the Si plateau to [Si/Fe]$_{\rm cc}=0.35$ and results in a non-zero value for $y_{\rm SI}^{\rm cc}$, unlike in \citet{weinberg_scale_2023}. Our yields are presented in Table \ref{tab:yields}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption{Nucleosynthetic yield sets.}
    \label{tab:yields}
    \include{output/yields.tex}
\end{table}

We increased $y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}$ by a factor of 30\% and 10\% for the {\tt yZ1} and {\tt yZ2} yield sets, respectively, to ensure our models could reach ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx0.0$ by the end time. The final row of Table \ref{tab:yields} reports the integrated SN Ia rate $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star$ from each yield set, assuming a mean Fe yield per SN Ia of $\bar m_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}=0.7$ M$_\odot$ \citep{mazzali_common_2007,howell_effect_2009} \todo{(are there more recent citations?)}. The rate for the {\tt yZ1} yield set is slightly higher than the volumetric rate of $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star=(1.3\pm0.1)\times10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ reported by \citet{maoz_star_2017}, but is consistent with their measurement of $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star=(1.6\pm0.3)\times10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ for field galaxies. The rate for the {\tt yZ2} yield set is consistent with the measurement of $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star=(2.2\pm1.0)\times10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ by \citet{maoz_type-ia_2012}.

The SN Ia rate in units of ${\rm M}_\odot^{-1}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm Ia}(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{N_{\rm Ia}}{M_\star}
        \frac{f_{\rm Ia}(t)}{\int_{t_D}^{t_{\rm max}} f_{\rm Ia}(t') dt'}, & t \ge t_D \\
        0 & t < t_D,
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:dtd-function}
\end{equation}
where $t_D=40$ Myr is the minimum SN Ia delay time, $t_{\rm max}=13.2$ Gyr is the lifetime of the disk, $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star$ is the total number of SNe Ia per ${\rm M}_\odot$ of stars formed, and $f_{\rm Ia}(t)$ is the un-normalized form of the DTD. Motivated by the results of \citet{dubay_galactic_2024}, we adopt a wide plateau DTD of the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:plateau-dtd}
    f_{\rm Ia}(t) =
    \begin{cases}
        1, & t < 1\,{\rm Gyr} \\
        (t/1\,{\rm Gyr})^{-1.1}, & t \ge 1\,{\rm Gyr}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
We discuss the implications of using a different DTD in Section \ref{sec:dtd-discussion}.

\todo{Compare these yields to previous studies.}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/yield_outflow.pdf}
    \caption{We manually adjusted the outflow mass-loading parameter $\eta$ and SN Ia yield $y ^{\rm Ia}_{\rm Fe}$ to match the data in the youngest age bin. Key takeaway: the higher yield sets produce slower recent evolution of [O/H] and [Fe/H], but a greater rise in [O/Fe] after the second infall. In contrast, the lower yield set leads to a more rapid evolution of [O/H] and [Fe/H], but a much smaller rise in [O/Fe] after the second infall.}
    \label{fig:onezone-dtd}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_sfr.pdf}
    \caption{Key takeaway: a fundamental attribute of any two-infall model is a bump in the number of stars on the low-alpha sequence where the abundance track turns over. This is because the star formation rate is near its peak while the rate of chemical evolution has slowed considerably.}
    \label{fig:onezone-sfr}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Outflows}
\label{sec:outflows}

Most of the previous two-infall studies assume no mass-loaded outflows. Even in studies such as \citet{palicio_analytic_2023} which do incorporate Galactic winds, they are relatively weak ($\eta\approx0.2$). 

\todo{Motivate our use of outflows. Connect to James' equilibrium paper.}

\citet{weinberg_equilibrium_2017} showed that in the limit of continuous star formation, the ISM abundance approaches an equilibrium which is determined by the balance of yields, outflows, and star formation. We calculate the mass-loading factor required to reach equilibrium at the Solar abundance as
\begin{equation}
    \eta_\odot = y_{\rm O}^{\rm CC} / Z_{\rm O,\odot} - 1 + r + \tau_\star / \tau_{\rm SFH},
\end{equation}
where $r=0.4$ is the instantaneous recycling parameter, $\tau_\star$ is the star formation efficiency timescale, and $\tau_{\rm SFH}$ is the star formation timescale.

We adopt a fiducial prescription for the outflow mass-loading factor which increases exponentially with radius:
\begin{equation}
    \eta(R_{\rm gal}) = \eta_\odot \exp\Big(\frac{R_{\rm gal}-R_\odot}{R_\eta}\Big)
\end{equation}
where $R_\odot=8$ kpc. As discussed by \citet{johnson_milky_2024}, the exponential outflow scale radius $R_\eta$ sets the equilibrium abundance gradient $\nabla{\rm [O/H]}_{\rm eq}$:
\begin{equation}
    R_\eta = -\frac{1}{\nabla{\rm [O/H]}_{\rm eq} \times\ln(10)}.
\end{equation}
We adopt $R_\eta=5.4$ kpc as our fiducial value, which corresponds to $\nabla{\rm [O/H]}_{\rm eq}=-0.08$ dex kpc$^{-1}$.
\todo{Motivate exponential scale radius.}

\subsection{The Gas Supply}
\label{sec:sfh}

We run {\tt VICE} in ``infall mode,'' where we specify the gas infall density $\dot\Sigma_{\rm in}$ and the star formation effieciency (SFE) timescale $\tau_\star\equiv \Sigma_g / \dot\Sigma_\star$ as functions of time. The gas surface density $\Sigma_g$ and star formation rate $\dot\Sigma_\star$ are calculated from the two specified quantities according to our star formation law, which is described in Section \ref{sec:sf-law}, assuming zero initial gas mass in all zones.

The infall rate as a function of time and galactocentric radius can generically be described by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:infall-rate}
    \dot\Sigma_{\rm in}(t,R_{\rm gal}) = A f_{\rm in}(t|R_{\rm gal}) g(R_{\rm gal}),
\end{equation}
where $g(R_{\rm gal})=\Sigma_\star(R_{\rm gal}) / \Sigma_\star(R_{\rm gal}=0)$ is the stellar density gradient, $f_{\rm in}$ is the infall rate over time, and $A$ is the normalization. Because we incorporate mass-loaded outflows, $A$ is not analytically solvable, so first we numerically integrate the star formation rate $\dot\Sigma_\star(t,R_{\rm gal})$ and then follow the procedure outlined in Appendix B of \citet{johnson_stellar_2021} to calculate $A$. The infall rate is normalized to produce a total disk stellar mass of $(5.17\pm1.11)\times 10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ \citep{licquia_improved_2015} and to match the stellar surface density gradient of \citet{bland-hawthorn_galaxy_2016}.

The infall rate is described by two successive, exponentially declining bursts in time. The first infall component induces the formation of the thick disk, and the second component produces the thin disk. At a given galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gal}$, the un-normalized infall rate is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:twoinfall-ifr}
    f_{\rm in}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = e^{-t/\tau_1} + f_{2/1}(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-(t-t_{\rm max})/\tau_2},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are the first and second infall timescales, respectively, $t_{\rm max}$ is the onset of the second infall and thus the time of maximum gas infall, and $f_{2/1}$ is the ratio of the second infall amplitude to the first. We calculate $f_{2/1}$ for each zone such that the resulting stellar density profile follows a two-component disk, with the surface density ratio of the thick and thin disks given by
\begin{equation}
    f_\Sigma(R) \equiv \frac{\Sigma_1(R)}{\Sigma_2(R)} = f_{\Sigma,0} e^{R(1/R_2 - 1/R_1)}.
\end{equation}
We adopt a thick disk scale radius of $R_1=2.0$ kpc, a thin disk scale radius of $R_2=2.5$ kpc, and a central surface density ratio of $f_{\Sigma,0}=0.27$ \citep{bland-hawthorn_galaxy_2016}.

The parameters of Equation \ref{eq:infall-rate} have important effects on the chemical evolution of the model. Previous studies of the two-infall model have adopted values for the infall parameters of $\tau_1\sim0.1-1$ Gyr, $\tau_2\sim4-10$ Gyr, and $t_{\rm max}\sim4$ Gyr. Figure \ref{fig:twoinfall-parameters} illustrates the effect of varying each of these parameters on gas abundance tracks and stellar abundance distributions in a one-zone model. The first infall timescale $\tau_1$ primarily affects the stellar distribution along the high-$\alpha$ sequence, with negligible effect on the low-$\alpha$ sequence (a). On the other hand, the second infall timescale $\tau_2$ controls the width of the MDF and the [O/Fe] distribution of the low-$\alpha$ sequence, with a shorter $\tau_2$ producing a distribution which is skewed to higher [O/Fe] (b). The time of maximum infall $t_{\rm max}$ strongly affects the overall stellar abundance distribution for values $t_{\rm max}\leq2$ Gyr, but in this case the gas tracks do not produce the characteristic loop characteristic of the two-infall model. For $t_{\rm max}>2$ Gyr, varying $t_{\rm max}$ results in a minor shift to the mean of the MDF and little change to the [O/Fe] distributions, even though the abundance tracks in [O/Fe]--[Fe/H] space appear very different. We find that $\tau_2$ is the most important parameter to tune in order to reproduce the observed stellar abundance distributions.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_params.pdf}
    \caption{Gas abundance tracks in the [O/Fe]--[Fe/H] plane for one-zone chemical evolution models which assume different values for the infall history parameters. In each panel, one parameter is varied according to the legend while the other two are held fixed. The open symbols along each curve mark logarithmic steps in time, as denoted in panel (b). The marginal panels show the corresponding stellar abundance distributions, which are convolved with a Gaussian kernel with a width of 0.02 dex for visual clarity. All models use the {\tt yZ1} yield set and assume $\eta=0.4$.}
    \label{fig:twoinfall-parameters}
\end{figure*}

In most of our models, we assume the infalling gas is pristine (i.e., $Z_{\rm in}=0$). However, the circumgalactic medium (CGM) from which the infalling gas is drawn could be previously enriched, either from gas stripped from dwarf galaxies or from SNe in the halo \todo{(citations; any measurements of CGM metallicity?)}. For this reason, we also test cases where the infalling gas is pre-enriched and its metallicity is described by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:pre-enrichment}
    Z_{\rm in}(t) = (1 - \exp(-t/\tau_{\rm rise})) Z_\odot 10^{{\rm [X/H]}_{\rm CGM}}.
\end{equation}
In this case, the metallicity rises from 0 with a timescale $\tau_{\rm rise}=2$ Gyr and plateaus at ${\rm [X/H]}_{\rm CGM}={\rm [O/H]}_{\rm CGM}={\rm [Fe/H]}_{\rm CGM}$. We also investigate cases where the CGM is $\alpha$-enhanced, i.e., ${\rm [O/Fe]}_{\rm CGM}>0$.

\subsection{The Star Formation Law}
\label{sec:sf-law}

The star formation law follows a single power-law prescription: $\dot\Sigma_\star\propto\Sigma_g^N$, with $N=1.5$ following \citet{kennicutt_global_1998}. Previous work with this GCE model \citep[e.g.,][]{johnson_stellar_2021,dubay_galactic_2024} assumed a three-component power-law, but we adopt a simpler prescription to allow for a more direct comparison with previous two-infall studies \citep[e.g.,][]{spitoni_remind_2024}. In detail, we calculate the star formation efficiency (SFE) timescale $\tau_\star\equiv\Sigma_g/\dot\Sigma_\star$ according to the following:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sf-law}
    \tau_\star = 
    \begin{cases}
        \epsilon(t) \tau_{\rm mol}(t),   & \Sigma_g \ge \Sigma_{g,0} \\
        \epsilon(t) \tau_{\rm mol}(t) \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,0}}\Big)^{-1/2}, & \Sigma_g < \Sigma_{g,0}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma_{g,0} = 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm kpc}^{-2}$ and $\tau_{\rm mol}(t)=\tau_{\rm mol,0}(t/t_0)^\gamma$ with $\gamma=1/2$ and $\tau_{\rm mol,0}=2$ Gyr. Previous two-infall studies \citep[e.g.,][]{nissen_high-precision_2020} have adopted a higher SFE during the first infall epoch than during the second, which we emulate through the pre-factor $\epsilon$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sfe-prefactor}
    \epsilon(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        0.5, & t < t_{\rm max} \\
        1.0, & t \ge t_{\rm max}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\todo{Talk about the implications of this prefactor or reference a future section which discusses this.}

\subsection{Stellar Migration}
\label{sec:migration}

The distance a stellar population born at $R_{\rm form}$ migrates over its age $\tau$ is drawn from a Gaussian centered at 0 with standard deviation
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\rm RM} = \sigma_{\rm RM8} \Big(\frac{\tau}{8\,{\rm Gyr}}\Big)^{0.33} \Big(\frac{R_{\rm form}}{8\,{\rm kpc}}\Big)^{0.61},
    \label{eq:radial-migration}
\end{equation}
where we adopt $\sigma_{\rm RM8}=2.68$ kpc as the fiducial value for the strength of radial migration. This is smaller than the value of $\sigma_{\rm RM8}=3.6$ kpc found by \citet{frankel_measuring_2018}, but in \todo{Section X} we explore the effect of a stronger migration prescription.

All stellar populations are born at the Galactic midplane and are assigned a final midplane distance $z$ drawn from the distribution
\begin{equation}
    p(z|\tau,R_{\rm final}) = \frac{1}{4 h_z} {\rm sech}^2\Big(\frac{z}{2 h_z}\Big),
    \label{eq:sech-pdf}
\end{equation}
where $R_{\rm final}$ is the final Galactocentric radius of the stellar population. The width of the distribution $h_z$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    h_z(\tau,R_{\rm final}) = \Big(\frac{0.24\,{\rm kpc}}{e^2}\Big) \exp\Big(\frac{\tau}{7\,{\rm Gyr}} + \frac{R_{\rm final}}{6\,{\rm kpc}}\Big).
    \label{eq:scale-height}
\end{equation}
We note that the final midplane distance is assigned at the end of the model run and therefore does not affect the chemical evolution.

The parameters of Equations \ref{eq:radial-migration} and \ref{eq:scale-height} were chosen to fit the stellar migration patterns in the {\tt h277} hydrodynamical simulation \citep{christensen_implementing_2012}. A more complete discussion of the migration scheme and its consequences can be found in Appendix C of \citet{dubay_galactic_2024}.

\todo{Copied from last paper.}
We compare our model results to abundance measurements from the final data release \citep[DR17;][]{abdurrouf_seventeenth_2022} of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment \citep[APOGEE;][]{majewski_apache_2017}. APOGEE used infrared spectrographs \citep{wilson_apache_2019} mounted on two telescopes: the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope \citep{gunn_25_2006} at Apache Point Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Ir{\'e}n{\'e}e DuPont Telescope \citep{bowen_optical_1973} at Las Campanas Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere. After the spectra were passed through the data reduction pipeline \citep{nidever_data_2015}, the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline \citep[ASPCAP;][]{holtzman_abundances_2015,garcia_perez_aspcap_2016} extracted chemical abundances using the model grids and interpolation method described by \citet{jonsson_apogee_2020}.

We restrict our sample to red giant branch and red clump stars with high-quality spectra. Table \ref{tab:sample} lists our selection criteria, which largely follow from \citet{Hayden2015-ChemicalCartography}. This produces a final sample of \input{output/sample_size.txt}stars with [O/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundance measurements. APOGEE stars are matched with their Bailer-Jones photo-geometric distance estimate from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 \citep{gaia_collaboration_gaia_2016,gaia_collaboration_gaia_2021}, which we use to calculate galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gal}$ and midplane distance $z$.

We use estimated ages from \citet[][hereafter \citetalias{leung_variational_2023}]{leung_variational_2023}, who use a variational encoder-decoder network which is trained on asteroseismic data to retrieve age estimates for APOGEE giants without contamination from age-abundance correlations. Importantly, the \citetalias{leung_variational_2023} ages do not plateau beyond $\sim10$ Gyr as they do in astroNN \citep{Mackereth2019-astroNN-Ages}. We use an age uncertainty cut of 40\% per the recommendations of \citetalias{leung_variational_2023}, which produces a total sample of \input{output/age_sample_size.txt}APOGEE stars with age estimates. We note that we use the full sample of \input{output/sample_size.txt}APOGEE stars unless we explicitly compare to age estimates. Table \ref{tab:sample} also presents the median uncertainties in the data for [Fe/H], [O/Fe], and age.

\section{Multi-Zone Model Results}
\label{sec:multizone-results}

\subsection{Stellar Abundance Distributions}



\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{src/tex/figures/ofe_df_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Stellar [O/Fe] distributions produced by multi-zone models (a--d) and as observed by APOGEE (d). Stars are binned by Galactocentric radius, represented by the color scale, and absolute midplane distance $|z|$, represented by the different rows. Each distribution is normalized so that the area under the curve is 1, and the vertical scale is consistent across each row. The median APOGEE abundance uncertainties were forward-modeled onto the model outputs. For visual clarity, each distribution is smoothed with a box-car of width 0.05 dex. Model (a) assumes the fiducial parameters and the {\tt yZ1} yield set, whereas models (b--d) assume the {\tt yZ2} yield set. Model (c) also assumes a power-law SN Ia DTD, while model (d) assumes the infalling gas has metallicity ${\rm [O/H]}_{\rm CGM}={\rm [Fe/H]}_{\rm CGM}=-0.7$. The distributions from APOGEE DR17 are plotted in column (e) for reference. {\bf Key takeaway:} The high-yield case produces a peak at intermediate [O/Fe] which is prominent in most galactic regions, which can be mitigated by pre-enriched infall.}
    \label{fig:ofe-df-yields}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Age--Abundance Relations}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/abundance_evolution.pdf}
    \caption{Stellar age--abundance relations produced by select multi-zone models. Each point represents a stellar population drawn from the Solar neighborhood near the mid-plane ($7\leq R_{\rm gal}\leq 9$ kpc, $0\leq |z| \leq 0.5$ kpc) and is color-coded by its birth radius. For visual clarity, we plot a only random mass-weighted sample of \num{10000} points in each panel. The dashed line plots the ISM abundance at $R_{\rm gal}=8$ kpc over time. The black points plot the median abundance of stars in 2 Gyr-wide age bins, and the vertical error bars represent the 16th and 84th percentiles of the age distribution. Similarly, the red points with error bars plot the median APOGEE abundances for stars with age estimates from \citet{leung_variational_2023}. Each column shows results from a different multi-zone model: {\bf (a)} our fiducial model, with $y/Z_\odot=1$, $\sigma_{\rm RM8}=2.7$ kpc, and pristine gas infall; {\bf (b)} a model with higher yields $y/Z_\odot=2$; {\bf (c)} a model with greater radial migration strength $\sigma_{\rm RM8}=5$ kpc; and {\bf (d)} a model which assumes the infalling gas has metallicity ${\rm [O/H]}_{\rm CGM}={\rm [Fe/H]}_{\rm CGM}=-0.7$. {\bf Key takeaway:} the fiducial model shows two discrepancies with the data: a major dilution event at a lookback time of $\sim9$ Gyr and non-zero abundance evolution at late times. Only model (b) with higher yields can mitigate both of these issues.}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{The SN Ia Delay-Time Distribution}
\label{sec:dtd-discussion}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/delay_time_distribution.pdf}
    \caption{The effect of the SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) on chemical abundance tracks and stellar distributions. {\it Left:} The relative SN Ia rate as a function of time after star formation for each DTD model. The points illustrate the median delay times for each DTD. {\it Right:} Output of one-zone models which assume different SN Ia DTDs with the {\tt yZ2} yield set. The infall parameters are fixed at $\tau_1=1$ Gyr, $\tau_2=10$ Gyr, and $\tau_{\rm on}=3$ Gyr. {\bf Key takeaway:} the extent of the low-$\alpha$ sequence can be reduced by a more prompt SN Ia DTD, but the high-$\alpha$ sequence is also shifted to a more metal-poor regime.}
    \label{fig:dtd}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:dtd} illustrates the effect of the SN Ia DTD on the abundance predictions by the two-infall model. The fiducial plateau DTD produces the strongest high-$\alpha$ peak as well as the greatest separation between the two low-$\alpha$ peaks. The exponential DTD produces the most stars near Solar [O/Fe], but the low-$\alpha$ sequence is still distinctly bimodal. Finally, the power-law DTD shrinks the low-$\alpha$ loop such that there is only one low-$\alpha$ peak; however, this DTD produces high-$\alpha$ stars at metallicities much lower than observed, as discussed in \citet{dubay_galactic_2024}.
