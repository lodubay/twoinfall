\section{Introduction}

% To add: Carme Gallart (2019) three-infall-ish, Kobayashi metallicity limit for SNe Ia and sub-Chandra

The two-infall model has long been proposed to explain the formation of the Milky Way's thick and thin disks. The infall history of any given region of the disk is described by two successive, exponentially declining bursts, whose timescale may vary as a function of radius. The first infall, which forms the thick disk, has a short timescale, typically on the order of $\sim0.1-1$ Gyr. The second infall forms the thin disk and has a much longer timescale, typically $\sim4-10$ Gyr.

\subsection{Summary of Two-Infall Papers}

% Summary of two-infall papers
\citet{matteucci_galactic_1989} modeled the galaxy with a two-component model, a one-zone model for the halo and concentric shell zones for the disk. They used a simple exponential gas infall (so not yet a two-infall model), where the infall timescale increased proportionally with radius. They studied cases with primordial and pre-enriched gas infall, finding that the former produces a more realistic metallicity distribution in the Solar neighborhood. Their inside-out disk evolution produced good agreement with observed abundance gradients.

\citet{chiappini_chemical_1997} presented the first two-infall model of the MW disk. They adopted an inside-out prescription for the formation of the thin disk, with the timescale of the second infall increasing linearly with radius. They assume the formation timescale of the thick disk is 1 Gyr, and the time of the second infall is 2 Gyr. They also assume a lower threshold on the gas density required for star formation, which produces a star formation hiatus at the end of the thick disk phase. They also noted the ``loop'' that appears in the \aFe--[Fe/H] relation during the thin disk phase. They mostly compare to Solar neighborhood data.

\citet{chiappini_abundance_2001} updated their model to fit the observed abundance, stellar, and gas gradients in the Milky Way disk. They find that a density threshold for star formation, making a gap in star formation between the halo and disk phases, is necessary to reproduce observational data. They argue that the details of halo formation also have a strong impact on the outer disk. No radial flows or outflows. I'm confused about their distinction between halo and thick disk, if any.

\citet{chiappini_oxygen_2003} compare model predictions of C, N, and O to Milky Way and other spiral galaxy data. They predict a very slow enrichment between the birth of the Sun and present day, which they claim is due to their adopted gas density threshold for star formation (the infall rate is low enough that the SFR oscillates from timestep to timestep).

\citet{matteucci_effect_2009} investigated different SN Ia delay time distributions using the \citep{chiappini_chemical_1997,chiappini_abundance_2001} model. They use a model for the full disk but compare only to Solar neighborhood data. They concluded that some prompt SN Ia enrichment is necessary to match observed abundance patterns.

\citet{spitoni_effects_2009} relaxed the instantaneous recycling approximation in two different ways: galactic fountains (i.e., SN ejecta are launched out of the disk and take some time to return) and metal cooling (i.e., newly-enriched hot gas takes time to cool before it can form stars). They found that fountains do not strongly affect the evolution of the $\alpha$-elements for short (few hundred Myr) timescales. The effect of a metal cooling timescale is similarly negligible if the yields are not dependent on metallicity.

\citet{spitoni_effects_2011} find that a two-infall model of the disk without gas exchange produces a radial metallicity gradient which is too shallow. They implement an inward radial gas flow on the order of $\sim0-4$ km s$^{-1}$ which varies with radius, and find that it improves agreement with the observed gradient. However, they found that a variable star formation efficiency with radius in combination with a gas density threshold for star formation could also reproduce the observed gradient without radial flows.

\citet{spitoni_effect_2015} add a simple radial migration scheme to the model of \citet{spitoni_effects_2011}. They adopt stellar velocities of $\sim 1$ km s$^{-1}$ and assume that some fixed fraction of stars born at a given radius will end up in the Solar vicinity (10\% of those born at 4 kpc and 20\% at 6 kpc). This mimics the results of previous dynamical models such as \citet{minchev_chemodynamical_2013}. They find that by including stellar migration, they are better able to reproduce the high-metallicity tail of the local metallicity distribution, and they also argue that they constrain the migration speed to $0.5 < v < 2$ km s$^{-1}$ based on this tail. Their only point of comparison with data is the local G-dwarf metallicity distribution.

\citet{grisoni_ambre_2017} argue for a ``parallel'' scenario, where the thick and thin disks form simultaneously but with very different infall timescales (0.1 and 7 Gyr, respectively). They compare their models with stellar abundances from the AMBRE sample of solar-neighborhood dwarfs. They argue that the parallel scenario can produce metal-rich high-alpha stars in situ, whereas in the two-infall scenario these stars would have to migrate from the inner disk.

\citet{palla_chemical_2020} explored radial gas flows, variable star formation efficiency of the thin disk, and the onset time of the second infall (but not the infall timescales). They find that inside-out formation (i.e., longer infall timescales in the outer disk) is not sufficient to reproduce observed abundance gradients, and that radial gas flows, possibly in combination with a radially-varying star formation law, are key. Pre-enriched infall in the inner disk ($R<8$ kpc) at the level of -0.5 dex also improves agreement with data.

% Radial gas flows
Some two-infall studies \citep[e.g.,][]{spitoni_effects_2011,palla_chemical_2020,palla_mapping_2024} implement inward radial gas flows with velocity $\sim1$ km s$^{-1}$ in order to reproduce the radial abundance gradient without Galactic outflows.

% Three-infall
Motivated by constraints on the SFH by {\it Gaia}, \citet{spitoni_beyond_2023} proposed the three-infall model, an extension with a third phase of exponential gas infall in the last few Gyr.

\citet{palla_mapping_2024} compare model predictions to abundances and ages of open clusters from the {\it Gaia}-ESO survey. They find that the two-infall model over-predicts the metallicity of the youngest clusters, a problem which is fixed by the three-infall model. A version of the three-infall model with milder dilution (mild pre-enrichment of the gas with a smaller amount of infall) compared to \citet{spitoni_beyond_2023} can simultaneously match the metalliticy of old, intermediate, and young clusters across the disk.

\subsection{Nucleosynthetic Yields}
\label{sec:yields}

The population-averaged nucleosynthetic yields of CCSNe are still fairly uncertain. 
% This problem is exacerbated by the complexity of the CCSN explosion landscape \citep{sukhbold_core-collapse_2016}. We adopt the yields of \citet{weinberg_scale_2023}, who use a measurement of the mean Fe yield of CC SNe by \citet{rodriguez_iron_2023} and the observed \aFe plateau to infer population-averaged yields. The only difference here is that we assume that $20\%$ of Si in the Sun is produced by SNe Ia, which reduces the Si plateau to [Si/Fe]$_{\rm cc}=0.35$ and results in a non-zero value for $y_{\rm SI}^{\rm cc}$, unlike in \citet{weinberg_scale_2023}. Our yields are presented in Table \ref{tab:yields}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption{Nucleosynthetic yield sets.}
    \label{tab:yields}
    \include{output/yields.tex}
\end{table}

Adopting a mean Fe yield per SN Ia of $m_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}=0.7$ M$_\odot$, the yield set $y/Z_\odot=1$ corresponds to an integrated SN Ia rate of $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star=\num{1.79e-3}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$, and the higher set $y/Z_\odot=3$ corresponds to $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star=\num{4.1e-3}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$.

\subsubsection{The SN Ia Delay-Time Distribution}
\label{sec:dtd}

The SN Ia rate in units of ${\rm M}_\odot^{-1}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm Ia}(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{N_{\rm Ia}}{M_\star}
        \frac{f_{\rm Ia}(t)}{\int_{t_D}^{t_{\rm max}} f_{\rm Ia}(t') dt'}, & t \ge t_D \\
        0 & t < t_D,
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:dtd-function}
\end{equation}
where $t_D$ is the minimum SN Ia delay time, $t_{\rm max}$ is the lifetime of the disk, $N_{\rm Ia}/M_\star$ is the total number of SNe Ia per ${\rm M}_\odot$ of stars formed, and $f_{\rm Ia}$ is the un-normalized form of the DTD. Motivated by the results of \citet{dubay_galactic_2024}, we adopt a wide plateau DTD of the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:plateau-dtd}
    f_{\rm Ia}(t) =
    \begin{cases}
        1, & t < 1\,{\rm Gyr} \\
        (t/1\,{\rm Gyr})^{-1.1}, & t \ge 1\,{\rm Gyr}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Outflows}
\label{sec:outflows}

\subsection{The Two-Infall Star Formation History}
\label{sec:sfh}

\todo{Copied from last paper.} First proposed by \citet{chiappini_chemical_1997}, this model parameterizes the infall rate as two successive, exponentially declining bursts to explain the origin of the high- and low-$\alpha$ disk populations:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:twoinfall-ifr}
    f_{\rm TI}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = N_1(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-t/\tau_1} + N_2(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-(t-t_{\rm on})/\tau_2},
\end{equation}
% In this model, the first infall produces the thick disk and the second infall produces the thin disk. 
where $\tau_1=1$ Gyr and $\tau_2=4$ Gyr are the exponential timescales of the first and second infall, respectively, and $t_{\rm on}=4$ Gyr is the onset time of the second infall \citep[based on typical values in, e.g.,][]{chiappini_chemical_1997,spitoni_galactic_2020,spitoni_apogee_2021}. $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the normalizations of the first and second infall, respectively, and their ratio $N_2/N_1$ is calculated so that the thick-to-thin-disk surface density ratio $f_\Sigma(R)=\Sigma_2(R)/\Sigma_1(R)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    f_\Sigma(R) = f_\Sigma(0) e^{R(1/R_2 - 1/R_1)}.
\end{equation}
Following \citet{bland-hawthorn_galaxy_2016}, we adopt values for the thick disk scale radius $R_1=2.0$ kpc, thin disk scale radius $R_2=2.5$ kpc, and $f_\Sigma(0)=0.27$.
We note that most previous studies which use the two-infall model \citep[e.g.][]{chiappini_chemical_1997,matteucci_new_2006,matteucci_effect_2009,spitoni_galactic_2019} do not consider gas outflows and instead adjust the nucleosynthetic yields to reproduce the solar abundance. We adopt radially-dependent outflows as in \citetalias{johnson_stellar_2021} (see their Section 2.4 for details) for all our SFHs, including two-infall. We discuss the implications of this difference in Section \ref{sec:two-infall-discussion}.

The star formation law follows a single power-law prescription: $\dot\Sigma_\star\propto\Sigma_g^N$, with $N=1.5$ following \citet{kennicutt_global_1998}. Previous work with this GCE model \citep[e.g.,][]{johnson_stellar_2021,dubay_galactic_2024} assumed a three-component power-law, but we adopt a simpler prescription to allow for a more direct comparison with previous two-infall studies \citep[e.g.,][]{spitoni_remind_2024}. In detail, we calculate the star formation efficiency (SFE) timescale $\tau_\star\equiv\Sigma_g/\dot\Sigma_\star$ according to the following:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sf-law}
    \tau_\star = 
    \begin{cases}
        \epsilon(t) \tau_{\rm mol}(t),   & \Sigma_g \ge \Sigma_{g,0} \\
        \epsilon(t) \tau_{\rm mol}(t) \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,0}}\Big)^{-1/2}, & \Sigma_g < \Sigma_{g,0}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma_{g,0} = 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm kpc}^{-2}$ and $\tau_{\rm mol}(t)=\tau_{\rm mol,0}(t/t_0)^\gamma$ with $\gamma=1/2$ and $\tau_{\rm mol,0}=2$ Gyr. Previous two-infall studies \citep[e.g.,][]{nissen_high-precision_2020} have adopted a higher SFE during the first infall epoch than during the second, which we emulate through the pre-factor $\epsilon$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sfe-prefactor}
    \epsilon(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        0.5, & t < t_{\rm on} \\
        1.0, & t \ge t_{\rm on}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\todo{Copied from last paper.}
We compare our model results to abundance measurements from the final data release \citep[DR17;][]{abdurrouf_seventeenth_2022} of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment \citep[APOGEE;][]{majewski_apache_2017}. APOGEE used infrared spectrographs \citep{wilson_apache_2019} mounted on two telescopes: the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope \citep{gunn_25_2006} at Apache Point Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Ir{\'e}n{\'e}e DuPont Telescope \citep{bowen_optical_1973} at Las Campanas Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere. After the spectra were passed through the data reduction pipeline \citep{nidever_data_2015}, the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline \citep[ASPCAP;][]{holtzman_abundances_2015,garcia_perez_aspcap_2016} extracted chemical abundances using the model grids and interpolation method described by \citet{jonsson_apogee_2020}.

We restrict our sample to red giant branch and red clump stars with high-quality spectra. Table \ref{tab:sample} lists our selection criteria, which largely follow from \citet{Hayden2015-ChemicalCartography}. This produces a final sample of \input{output/sample_size.txt}stars with [O/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundance measurements. APOGEE stars are matched with their Bailer-Jones photo-geometric distance estimate from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 \citep{gaia_collaboration_gaia_2016,gaia_collaboration_gaia_2021}, which we use to calculate galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gal}$ and midplane distance $z$.

We use estimated ages from \citet[][hereafter \citetalias{leung_variational_2023}]{leung_variational_2023}, who use a variational encoder-decoder network which is trained on asteroseismic data to retrieve age estimates for APOGEE giants without contamination from age-abundance correlations. Importantly, the \citetalias{leung_variational_2023} ages do not plateau beyond $\sim10$ Gyr as they do in astroNN \citep{Mackereth2019-astroNN-Ages}. We use an age uncertainty cut of 40\% per the recommendations of \citetalias{leung_variational_2023}, which produces a total sample of \input{output/age_sample_size.txt}APOGEE stars with age estimates. We note that we use the full sample of \input{output/sample_size.txt}APOGEE stars unless we explicitly compare to age estimates. Table \ref{tab:sample} also presents the median uncertainties in the data for [Fe/H], [O/Fe], and age.

    \caption{We manually adjusted the outflow mass-loading parameter $\eta$ and SN Ia yield $y ^{\rm Ia}_{\rm Fe}$ to match the data in the youngest age bin. Key takeaway: the higher yield sets produce slower recent evolution of [O/H] and [Fe/H], but a greater rise in [O/Fe] after the second infall. In contrast, the lower yield set leads to a more rapid evolution of [O/H] and [Fe/H], but a much smaller rise in [O/Fe] after the second infall.}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/delay_time_distribution.pdf}
    \caption{The model parameters are fixed at $\tau_1=1$ Gyr, $\tau_2=15$ Gyr, and $\tau_{\rm on}=3.2$ Gyr. Key takeaway: the size of the loop can be reduced by using an SN Ia DTD with more prompt events. However, this messes up the location of the high-alpha sequence.}
    \label{fig:dtd}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:dtd} illustrates the effect of the SN Ia DTD on the abundance predictions by the two-infall model. The fiducial plateau DTD produces the strongest high-$\alpha$ peak as well as the greatest separation between the two low-$\alpha$ peaks. The exponential DTD produces the most stars near Solar [O/Fe], but the low-$\alpha$ sequence is still distinctly bimodal. Finally, the power-law DTD shrinks the low-$\alpha$ loop such that there is only one low-$\alpha$ peak; however, this DTD produces high-$\alpha$ stars at metallicities much lower than observed, as discussed in \citet{dubay_galactic_2024}.

We would like to acknowledge the land that The Ohio State University occupies is the ancestral and contemporary territory of the Shawnee, Potawatomi, Delaware, Miami, Peoria, Seneca, Wyandotte, Ojibwe and many other Indigenous peoples. Specifically, the university resides on land ceded in the 1795 Treaty of Greeneville and the forced removal of tribes through the Indian Removal Act of 1830. As a land grant institution, we want to honor the resiliency of these tribal nations and recognize the historical contexts that has and continues to affect the Indigenous peoples of this land.
