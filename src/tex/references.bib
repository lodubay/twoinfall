	abstract = {Aims: Our aim is to show how different hypotheses about type Ia supernova progenitors can affect Galactic chemical evolution. Supernovae Ia are believed to be the main producers of Fe and the timescale with which Fe is restored into the interstellar medium depends on the assumed supernova progenitor model. This is a way of selecting the most appropriate progenitor model for supernovae Ia, a still debated issue. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We include different type Ia SN progenitor models, identified by their distribution of time delays, in a very detailed chemical evolution model for the Milky Way which follows the evolution of several chemical species. We test the single degenerate and the double degenerate models for supernova Ia progenitors, as well as other more empirical models based on differences in the time delay distributions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We find that assuming the single degenerate or the double degenerate scenario produces negligible differences in the predicted [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation. On the other hand, assuming a percentage of prompt (exploding in the first 100 Myr) type Ia supernovae of 50\%, or that the maximum type Ia rate is reached after 3-4 Gyr from the beginning of star formation, as suggested by several authors, produces more noticeable effects on the [O/Fe] trend. However, given the spread still existing in the observational data, no model can be firmly excluded on the basis of only the [O/Fe] ratios. On the other hand, when the predictions of the different models are compared with the G-dwarf metallicity distribution, the scenarios with very few prompt type Ia supernovae can be excluded. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: Models including the single degenerate or double degenerate scenario with a percentage of 10-13\% of prompt type Ia supernovae produce results in very good agreement with the observations. A fraction of prompt type Ia supernovae larger than 30\% worsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no prompt type Ia supernovae are allowed. In particular, two empirical models for the type Ia SN progenitors can be excluded: the one without prompt type Ia supernovae and the one assuming a delay time distribution that is ∝t{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-0.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We conclude that the typical timescale for the Fe enrichment in the Milky Way is around 1-1.5 Gyr and that type Ia supernovae already should appear during the halo phase.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2304.00042},
	abstract = {Context: In the last years, a significant number of works have focused on finding analytic solutions for the chemical enrichment models of galactic systems, including the Milky Way. Some of these solutions, however, cannot account for the enrichment produced by Type Ia SNe due to the presence of the delay time distributions (DTDs) in the models. Aims: We present a new analytic solution for the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy. This solution can be used with different prescriptions of the DTD, including the single and double degenerate scenarios, and allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of pristine gas infalls. Methods: We integrate the chemical evolution model by extending the instantaneous recycling approximation with the contribution of Type Ia SNe. For those DTDs that lead to non-analytic integrals, we describe them as a superposition of Gaussian, exponential and 1/t functions using a restricted least-squares fitting method. Results: We obtain the exact solution for a chemical model with Type Ia SNe widely used in previous works. This solution can reproduce the expected chemical evolution of the alpha and iron-peak elements in less computing time than numerical integration methods. We compare the pattern in the [Si/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane observed by APOGEE DR17 with that predicted by the model. We find the low alpha sequence can be explained by a delayed gas infall. We exploit the applicability of our solution by modelling the chemical evolution of a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy from its star formation history. The implementation of our solution is released as a python package. Conclusions: Our solution constitutes a promising tool for the Galactic Archaeology and is able to model the observed trends in alpha element abundances versus [Fe/H] in the solar neighbourhood. We infer the chemical information of a simulated galaxy modelled without Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The recent Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) represents an unparalleled revolution in Galactic Archaeology, providing us with numerous radial velocities chemical abundances for million of stars, overcoming the spatial biases that ground-based spectroscopic surveys suffer from ground-based surveys. We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galactic disc components (high- and low- \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence stars) designed to reproduce the new abundance ratios provided by the GSP-spec module for the Gaia DR3 and also constrained by i) stellar ages and ii) detailed star formation histories for both the thick and thin disc stars inferred from previous Gaia releases. Gaia DR3 highlighted the presence of young (massive) low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ disc stars which show evidence of a recent chemical impoverishment in several elements. Additionally, previous Gaia releases have found evidence for narrow episodes of enhanced SF inferred in recent time. In order to reproduce these observables, we propose a new chemical evolution model in which the low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence is generated by two distinct infall episodes. Hence, in this study we compare Gaia DR3 chemical abundances with the predictions of a three-infall chemical evolution model for the high- and low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ components. The proposed three-infall chemical evolution model nicely reproduces the main features of the abundance ratio [X/Fe] versus [M/H] (X=Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, \${\textbackslash}alpha\$) of Gaia DR3 stars in different age bins for the considered \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ elements. Moreover, the most recent gas infall - which started \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 2.7 Gyr ago - allows us to predict well the Gaia DR3 young population which has experienced a recent chemical impoverishment.},

	abstract = {Context. The analysis of the latest release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment project (APOGEE DR16) data suggests the existence of a clear distinction between two sequences of disc stars at different Galactocentric distances in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratio space: the so-called high-α sequence, classically associated with an old population of stars in the thick disc with high average [α/Fe], and the low-α sequence, which mostly comprises relatively young stars in the thin disc with low average [α/Fe]. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to constrain a multi-zone two-infall chemical evolution model designed for regions at different Galactocentric distances using measured chemical abundances from the APOGEE DR16 sample. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We performed a Bayesian analysis based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to fit our multi-zone two-infall chemical evolution model to the APOGEE DR16 data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: An inside-out formation of the Galaxy disc naturally emerges from the best fit of our two-infall chemical-evolution model to APOGEE-DR16: Inner Galactic regions are assembled on shorter timescales compared to the external ones. In the outer disc (with radii R \&gt; 6 kpc), the chemical dilution due to a late accretion event of gas with a primordial chemical composition is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance pattern in the low-α sequence. In the inner disc, in the framework of the two-infall model, we confirm the presence of an enriched gas infall in the low-α phase as suggested by chemo-dynamical models. Our Bayesian analysis of the recent APOGEE DR16 data suggests a significant delay time, ranging from ∼3.0 to 4.7 Gyr, between the first and second gas infall events for all the analysed Galactocentric regions. The best fit model reproduces several observational constraints such as: (i) the present-day stellar and gas surface density profiles; (ii) the present-day abundance gradients; (iii) the star formation rate profile; and (iv) the solar abundance values. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results propose a clear interpretation of the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relations along the Galactic discs. The signatures of a delayed gas-rich merger which gives rise to a hiatus in the star formation history of the Galaxy are impressed in the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation, determining how the low-α stars are distributed in the abundance space at different Galactocentric distances, which is in agreement with the finding of recent chemo-dynamical simulations.},

	abstract = {Context. With the wealth of information from large surveys and observational campaigns in the contemporary era, it is critical to properly exploit the data to constrain the parameters of Galactic chemical evolution models and quantify the associated uncertainties. Aims: We aim to constrain the two-infall chemical evolution models for the solar annulus using the measured chemical abundance ratios and seismically inferred age of stars in the APOKASC sample. Recently, in revised two-infall chemical evolution models, a significant delay of ∼4.3 Gyr has been invoked between the two episodes of gas accretion. In this work, we wish to test its robustness and statistically confirm and quantify the delay. Methods: We took a novel approach, using Bayesian framework based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit the two-infall chemical evolution models to the data. Results: In addition to fitting the data for stars in the APOKASC sample, our best fit models also reproduce other important observational constraints of the chemical evolution of the disk: i) present day stellar surface density; ii) present-day supernova and star formation rates; iii) the metallicity distribution function; and iv) solar abundance values. We find a significant delay between the two gas accretion episodes for various models explored with different values for the star formation efficiencies. The values for the delay lie in the range 4.5-5.5 Gyr. Conclusions: The results suggest that the APOKASC sample carries the signature of a delayed gas-rich merger, with dilution being the main process determining the shape of low-α stars in the abundance ratios space.},

Recently, asteroseismology has confirmed a clear age difference in the solar annulus between two distinct sequences in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratios relation: the high-α and low-α stellar populations. Aims: We aim to reproduce these new data with chemical evolution models including different assumptions for the history and number of accretion events. Methods: We tested two different approaches: a revised version of the "two-infall" model where the high-α phase forms by a fast gas accretion episode and the low-α sequence follows later from a slower gas infall rate, and the parallel formation scenario where the two disc sequences form coevally and independently. Results: The revised two-infall model including uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic epochs, ii) the age-metallicity relation and the time evolution [α/Fe]; iii) the age distribution of the high-α and low-α stellar populations, iv) the metallicity distribution function. The parallel approach is not capable of properly reproducing the stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. Conclusions: The best chemical evolution model is the revised two-infall one, where a consistent delay of ∼4.3 Gyr in the beginning of the second gas accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar abundances and ages.},

	abstract = {We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes two main infall episodes, for the formation of the halo-thick disk and thin disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available. Our model fits these new data very well. The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that, in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of {\textless}=1 Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation in the solar vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of the disk (R {\textless} 1 R⊙) are steeper than in the outer regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of the star formation process are discussed.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of bursts in star formation on the predictions of one-zone chemical evolution models, adopting oxygen (O), iron (Fe), and strontium (Sr), as representative α, iron-peak, and s-process elements, respectively. To this end, we develop and make use of the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE), a PYTHON package designed to handle flexible user-specified evolutionary parameters. Starbursts driven by a temporary boost of gas accretion rate create loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolutionary tracks and a peak in the stellar [O/Fe] distribution at intermediate values. Bursts driven by a temporary boost of star formation efficiency have similar effects, and they also produce a population of α-deficient stars during the depressed star formation phase following the burst. This α-deficient population is more prominent if the outflow rate is tied to a time-averaged star formation rate (SFR) instead of the instantaneous SFR. Theoretical models of Sr production predict a strong metallicity dependence of supernova and asymptotic giant branch star yields, though comparison to data suggests an additional, nearly metallicity-independent source. Evolution of [Sr/Fe] and [Sr/O] during a starburst is complex because of this metallicity dependence and the multiple time-scales at play. Moderate amplitude (10-20 per cent) sinusoidal oscillations in SFR produce loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks and multiple peaks in [O/Fe] distributions, a potential source of intrinsic scatter in observed sequences. We investigate the impact of a factor {\textasciitilde}2 enhancement of Galactic star formation {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago, as suggested by some recent observations. VICE is publicly available at .},
