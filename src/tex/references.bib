	abstract = {We present a systematic analysis of 191 stripped-envelope supernovae (SE SNe), aimed at computing their 56Ni masses from the luminosity in their radioactive tails ( \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Ni\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{tail\}\}\$ ) and/or in their maximum light, and the mean 56Ni and iron yields of SE SNe and core-collapse SNe. Our sample consists of SNe IIb, Ib, and Ic from the literature and from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. To calculate luminosities from optical photometry, we compute bolometric corrections using 49 SE SNe with optical and near-IR photometry, and develop corrections to account for the unobserved UV and IR flux. We find that the equation of Khatami \& Kasen for radioactive 56Ni-powered transients with a single free parameter does not fit the observed peak time-luminosity relation of SE SNe. Instead, we find a correlation between \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Ni\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{tail\}\}\$ , peak time, peak luminosity, and decline rate, which allows for measuring individual 56Ni masses to a precision of 14\%. Applying this method to the whole sample, we find, for SNe IIb, Ib, and Ic, mean 56Ni masses of 0.066 ± 0.006, 0.082 ± 0.009, and 0.132 ± 0.011 M ⊙, respectively. After accounting for their relative rates, for SE SNe as a whole, we compute mean 56Ni and iron yields of 0.090 ± 0.005 and 0.097 ± 0.007 M ⊙, respectively. Combining these results with the recent Type II SN mean 56Ni mass derived by Rodríguez et al., core-collapse SNe, as a whole, have mean 56Ni and iron yields of 0.055 ± 0.006 and 0.058 ± 0.007 M ⊙, respectively. We also find that radioactive 56Ni-powered models typically underestimate the peak luminosity of SE SNe by 60\%-70\%, suggesting the presence of an additional power source contributing to the luminosity at peak.},

	abstract = {I review the spatially resolved spectroscopic properties of low-redshift star-forming galaxies (and their retired counterparts) using results from the most recent optical integral field spectroscopy galaxy surveys. First, I briefly summarize the global spectroscopic properties of these galaxies, discussing the main ionization processes and the global relations described by the star-formation rates, gas-phase oxygen abundances, and average properties of their stellar populations (age and metallicity) in comparison with the stellar mass. Second, I present the local distribution of the ionizing processes down to kiloparsec scales, and I show how the global scaling relations found using integrated parameters (like the star-formation main sequence, mass-metallicity relation, and Schmidt-Kennicutt law) have local/resolved counterparts, with the global ones being, for the most part, just integrated/average versions of the local ones. I discuss the local/resolved star-formation histories (SFHs) and chemical-enrichment histories and their implications on the inside-out growth of galaxies. Third, I present the radial distributions of the surface densities of the properties explored globally and how they depend on the integrated galaxy properties. In conclusion, I find that the evolution of galaxies is mostly governed by local processes but clearly affected by global ones: Many global scaling relations present resolved counterparts (verified down to kiloparsec scales) that can explain them as well as the observed radial gradients in galaxies. These relations are consequences of the local SFHs, the narrow range of the depletion times, and a local metal enrichment. Deviations from these relations are due to dynamical and mixing processes, local exchange of gas (inflows, outflows, and fountains), depletion time differences, and/or differences in the resolved SFHs. Ionization happens at local scales that may be driven by different physical processes, and it cannot be clearly understood using purely integrated quantities. The dominant ionization in galaxies has a stellar origin.},

	abstract = {Context. The analysis of the latest release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment project (APOGEE DR16) data suggests the existence of a clear distinction between two sequences of disc stars at different Galactocentric distances in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratio space: the so-called high-α sequence, classically associated with an old population of stars in the thick disc with high average [α/Fe], and the low-α sequence, which mostly comprises relatively young stars in the thin disc with low average [α/Fe]. Aims: We aim to constrain a multi-zone two-infall chemical evolution model designed for regions at different Galactocentric distances using measured chemical abundances from the APOGEE DR16 sample. Methods: We performed a Bayesian analysis based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to fit our multi-zone two-infall chemical evolution model to the APOGEE DR16 data. Results: An inside-out formation of the Galaxy disc naturally emerges from the best fit of our two-infall chemical-evolution model to APOGEE-DR16: Inner Galactic regions are assembled on shorter timescales compared to the external ones. In the outer disc (with radii R {\textgreater} 6 kpc), the chemical dilution due to a late accretion event of gas with a primordial chemical composition is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance pattern in the low-α sequence. In the inner disc, in the framework of the two-infall model, we confirm the presence of an enriched gas infall in the low-α phase as suggested by chemo-dynamical models. Our Bayesian analysis of the recent APOGEE DR16 data suggests a significant delay time, ranging from ∼3.0 to 4.7 Gyr, between the first and second gas infall events for all the analysed Galactocentric regions. The best fit model reproduces several observational constraints such as: (i) the present-day stellar and gas surface density profiles; (ii) the present-day abundance gradients; (iii) the star formation rate profile; and (iv) the solar abundance values. Conclusions: Our results propose a clear interpretation of the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relations along the Galactic discs. The signatures of a delayed gas-rich merger which gives rise to a hiatus in the star formation history of the Galaxy are impressed in the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation, determining how the low-α stars are distributed in the abundance space at different Galactocentric distances, which is in agreement with the finding of recent chemo-dynamical simulations.},

	abstract = {Context. With the wealth of information from large surveys and observational campaigns in the contemporary era, it is critical to properly exploit the data to constrain the parameters of Galactic chemical evolution models and quantify the associated uncertainties. Aims: We aim to constrain the two-infall chemical evolution models for the solar annulus using the measured chemical abundance ratios and seismically inferred age of stars in the APOKASC sample. Recently, in revised two-infall chemical evolution models, a significant delay of ∼4.3 Gyr has been invoked between the two episodes of gas accretion. In this work, we wish to test its robustness and statistically confirm and quantify the delay. Methods: We took a novel approach, using Bayesian framework based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit the two-infall chemical evolution models to the data. Results: In addition to fitting the data for stars in the APOKASC sample, our best fit models also reproduce other important observational constraints of the chemical evolution of the disk: i) present day stellar surface density; ii) present-day supernova and star formation rates; iii) the metallicity distribution function; and iv) solar abundance values. We find a significant delay between the two gas accretion episodes for various models explored with different values for the star formation efficiencies. The values for the delay lie in the range 4.5-5.5 Gyr. Conclusions: The results suggest that the APOKASC sample carries the signature of a delayed gas-rich merger, with dilution being the main process determining the shape of low-α stars in the abundance ratios space.},

	abstract = {Aims: Previous high-precision studies of abundances of elements in solar twin stars are extended to a wider metallicity range to see how the trends of element ratios with stellar age depend on [Fe/H]. Methods: HARPS spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S/N ≳ 600 at λ ∼ 6000 Å were analysed with MARCS model atmospheres to obtain 1D LTE abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Sr, and Y for 72 nearby solar-type stars with metallicities in the range of -0.3 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.3 and ASTEC stellar models were used to determine stellar ages from effective temperatures, luminosities obtained via Gaia DR2 parallaxes, and heavy element abundances. Results: The age-metallicity distribution appears to consist of the following two distinct populations: a sequence of old stars with a steep rise of [Fe/H] to ∼ + 0.3 dex at an age of ∼7 Gyr and a younger sequence with [Fe/H] increasing from about -0.3 dex to ∼ + 0.2 dex over the last 6 Gyr. Furthermore, the trends of several abundance ratios, [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ni/Fe], as a function of stellar age, split into two corresponding sequences. The [Y/Mg]-age relation, on the other hand, shows no offset between the two age sequences and has no significant dependence on [Fe/H], but the components of a visual binary star, ζ Reticuli, have a large and puzzling deviation. Conclusions: The split of the age-metallicity distribution into two sequences may be interpreted as evidence of two episodes of accretion of gas onto the Galactic disk with a quenching of star formation in between. Some of the [X/Fe]-age relations support this scenario but other relations are not so easy to explain, which calls for a deeper study of systematic errors in the derived abundances as a function of [Fe/H], in particular 3D non-LTE effects.

Our sample includes 17 of the 19 fields observed by K2, making it one of the most comprehensive catalogs of accurate stellar ages across the Galaxy in terms of the wide range of populations spanned by its stars, enabling rigorous tests of Galactic chemical evolution models. Taking into account the selection functions of the K2 sample, the data appear to support the age‑chemistry morphology of stellar populations predicted by both inside-out and late-burst scenarios. We also investigate trends in age versus stellar chemistry and Galactic position, which are consistent with previous findings. Comparisons against APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages show agreement to within ∼3\%. We also discuss offsets between our ages and spectroscopic ages. Finally, we note that ignoring the effects of α-enhancement on stellar opacity (either directly or with the Salaris metallicity correction) results in an ∼10\% offset in age estimates for the most α-enhanced stars, which is an important consideration for continued tests of Galactic models with this and other asteroseismic age samples.},

	abstract = {The kinematics of the Milky Way disc as a function of age are well measured at the solar radius, but have not been studied over a wider range of Galactocentric radii. Here, we measure the kinematics of mono-age, mono-[Fe/H] populations in the low and high [α/Fe] discs between 4 ≲ R ≲ 13 kpc and {\textbar}z{\textbar} ≲ 2 kpc using 65 719 stars in common between APOGEE DR14 and Gaia DR2 for which we estimate ages using a Bayesian neural network model trained on asteroseismic ages. We determine the vertical and radial velocity dispersions, finding that the low and high [α/Fe] discs display markedly different age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) and shapes σz/σR. The high [α/Fe] disc has roughly flat AVRs and constant σz/σR = 0.64 ± 0.04, whereas the low [α/Fe] disc has large variations in this ratio that positively correlate with the mean orbital radius of the population at fixed age. The high [α/Fe] disc component's flat AVRs and constant σz/σR clearly indicate an entirely different heating history. Outer disc populations also have flatter radial AVRs than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning effect of spiral arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and σz/σR across the disc indicate that low [α/Fe], inner disc (R ≲ 10 kpc) stellar populations are likely dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while the observed trends for outer disc populations require a significant contribution from another heating mechanism such as satellite perturbations. We also find that outer disc populations have slightly positive mean vertical and radial velocities likely because they are part of the warped disc.},

	abstract = {Constraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy require multidimensional measurements of kinematics, abundances, and ages for a large population of stars. Ages for luminous giants, which can be seen to large distances, are an essential component of studies of the Milky Way, but they are traditionally very difficult to estimate precisely for a large data set and often require careful analysis on a star-by-star basis in asteroseismology. Because spectra are easier to obtain for large samples, being able to determine precise ages from spectra allows for large age samples to be constructed, but spectroscopic ages are often imprecise and contaminated by abundance correlations. Here we present an application of a variational encoder-decoder on cross-domain astronomical data to solve these issues. The model is trained on pairs of observations from APOGEE and Kepler of the same star in order to reduce the dimensionality of the APOGEE spectra in a latent space while removing abundance information. The low dimensional latent representation of these spectra can then be trained to predict age with just {\textasciitilde}1000 precise seismic ages. We demonstrate that this model produces more precise spectroscopic ages (\${\textbackslash}sim 22{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ overall, \${\textbackslash}sim 11{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ for red-clump stars) than previous data-driven spectroscopic ages while being less contaminated by abundance information (in particular, our ages do not depend on [α/M]). We create a public age catalogue for the APOGEE DR17 data set and use it to map the age distribution and the age-[Fe/H]-[α/M] distribution across the radial range of the Galactic disc.},

We use data on the positions and velocities of stars in the solar neighbourhood from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and large spectroscopic surveys to investigate the vertical number counts and mean velocity trend as a function of distance from the local Galactic mid-plane. We perform a detailed measurement of the wave-like north-south asymmetry in the vertical number counts, which reveals a number of deficits at heights ≈0.4, ≈0.9, and \{≈ \} 1.5 kpc, and peaks at ≈0.2, ≈0.7, and \{≈ \} 1.1 kpc. We find that the asymmetry pattern is independent of colour. The mean vertical velocity is almost constant to {\textless} 1 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} within a few 100 pc from the mid-plane and then displays a north-south symmetric dip at \{≈ \}0.5 kpc with an amplitude of \{≈ \} 2 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} that is a plausible velocity counterpart to the main number count dip at a similar height. Thus, with Gaia DR2 we confirm at high fidelity that the local Galactic disc is undergoing a wave-like oscillation and a dynamically consistent observational picture of the perturbed local vertical structure emerges for the first time. We also present the most precise and accurate determination of the Sun's height above the local Galactic mid-plane, correcting for any asymmetry in the vertical density: z\_\{⊙\} = 20.8 ± 0.3 pc.},

Near pericentre at 120 AU ≈ 1400 Schwarzschild radii, the star has an orbital speed of ≈7650 km s-1, such that the first-order effects of Special and General Relativity have now become detectable with current capabilities. Over the past 26 years, we have monitored the radial velocity and motion on the sky of S2, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics instruments on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and since 2016 and leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018, with the four-telescope interferometric beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. From data up to and including pericentre, we robustly detect the combined gravitational redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 of z = Δλ / λ ≈ 200 km s-1/c with different statistical analysis methods. When parameterising the post-Newtonian contribution from these effects by a factor f , with f = 0 and f = 1 corresponding to the Newtonian and general relativistic limits, respectively, we find from posterior fitting with different weighting schemes f = 0.90 ± 0.09{\textbar}stat ± 0.15{\textbar}sys.

	abstract = {Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major contribution to this. Despite Gaia's precision, the majority of these stars are so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction and Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax with a direction-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally uses the color and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that stars of a given color have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes (plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalog of 1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly in the distance modulus ( \$5\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\}\_\{10\}r{\textbackslash},-{\textbackslash},5\$ ). The catalog may be downloaded or queried using ADQL at various sites (see http://www.mpia.de/{\textasciitilde}calj/gedr3\_distances.html), where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalog.},

	abstract = {Using a sample of 69,919 red giants from the SDSS-III/APOGEE Data Release 12, we measure the distribution of stars in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plane and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) across an unprecedented volume of the Milky Way disk, with radius 3 {\textless} R {\textless} 15 kpc and height {\textbar} z{\textbar} 2 kpc. Stars in the inner disk (R {\textless} 5 kpc) lie along a single track in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H], starting with α-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at [α/Fe] ∼ 0 and [Fe/H] ∼ +0.4. At larger radii we find two distinct sequences in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, with a roughly solar-α sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-α sequence that merges with the low-α sequence at super-solar [Fe/H]. The location of the high-α sequence is nearly constant across the disk however, there are very few high-α stars at R {\textgreater} 11 kpc. The peak of the midplane MDF shifts to lower metallicity at larger R, reflecting the Galactic metallicity gradient. Most strikingly, the shape of the midplane MDF changes systematically with radius, from a negatively skewed distribution at 3 {\textless} R {\textless} 7 kpc, to a roughly Gaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in the outer Galaxy. For stars with {\textbar} z{\textbar} 1 kpc or [α/Fe] {\textgreater} 0.18, the MDF shows little dependence on R. The positive skewness of the outer-disk MDF may be a signature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations by orbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of MDF shape, but a simple model of radial migration can do so.},

	abstract = {We develop and apply a model to quantify the global efficiency of radial orbit migration among stars in the Milky Way disk. This model parameterizes the possible star formation and enrichment histories and radial birth profiles, and combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital radii to birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age τ as \{σ \vphantom{\{}\}RM8\}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{τ /8 \{Gyr\}\}. Guided by observations, we assume that stars are born with an initially tight age-metallicity relation at given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration, thereby providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration strength \{σ \vphantom{\{}\}RM8\}. We fit this model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the observed age-metallicity distribution of low-α red clump stars with Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the complex spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age uncertainties. This simple model reproduces the observed data well, and we find a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration efficiency in the Milky Way of \{σ \vphantom{\{}\}RM8\} = 3.6 ± 0.1 kpc when marginalizing over all other aspects of the model. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way’s main disk is indeed rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars migrate by about a half-mass radius over the age of the disk. The model finds the Sun’s birth radius at ∼5.2 kpc. If such strong radial orbit migration is typical, this mechanism indeed plays an important role in setting the structural regularity of disk galaxies.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the observed connection between molecular hydrogen (H2) and star formation, we present a method for tracking the non-equilibrium abundance and cooling processes of H2 and H2-based star formation in smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations. The local abundances of H2 are calculated by integrating over the hydrogen chemical network. This calculation includes the gas phase and dust grain formation of H2, shielding of H2 and photodissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation from nearby stellar populations. Because this model does not assume equilibrium abundances, it is particularly well suited for simulations that model low-metallicity environments, such as dwarf galaxies and the early Universe. We further introduce an explicit link between star formation and local H2 abundance. This link limits star formation to 'star-forming regions', represented by areas with abundant H2. We use simulations of isolated disc galaxies to verify that the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen occurs at realistic densities and surface densities. Using these same isolated galaxies, we establish that gas particles of 104 M⊙ or less are necessary to follow the molecular gas in this implementation. With this implementation, we determine the effect of H2 on star formation in a cosmological simulation of a dwarf galaxy. This simulation is the first cosmological simulation with non-equilibrium H2 abundances to be integrated to a redshift of zero or to include efficient supernova feedback. We analyse the amount and distribution of star formation in the galaxy using simulated observations of the H I gas and in various optical bands. From these simulated observations, we find that our simulations are consistent with the observed Tully-Fisher, global Kennicutt-Schmidt and resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. We find that the inclusion of shielding of both the atomic and molecular hydrogen and, to a lesser extent, the additional cooling from H2 at temperatures between 200 and 5000 K increases the amount of cold gas in the galaxies. The changes to the interstellar medium (ISM) result in an increased amount of cold, dense gas in the disc of the galaxy and the formation of a clumpier ISM. The explicit link between star formation and H2 and the clumpier ISM results in a bluer galaxy with a greater spatial distribution of star formation at a redshift of zero.},

	abstract = {Timmes et al. found that metallicity variations could theoretically account for a 25\% variation in the mass of 56Ni synthesized in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter in observed SN Ia luminosities. Higher-metallicity progenitors are more neutron rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive 56Ni. We develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56Ni yield in SNe Ia and use it to test the theory with data from the Supernova Legacy Survey. We find that the average 56Ni yield does drop in SNe Ia from high-metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7\%-10\% of the dispersion in SN Ia 56Ni mass, and thus luminosity. This is because the effect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we find that SN hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solar metallicities. We also show that allowing for changes in O/Fe with the metallicity [Fe/H] does not have a major effect on the theoretical prediction of Timmes et al., so long as one is using the O/H as the independent variable. Age may have a greater effect than metallicity—we find that the luminosity-weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56Ni yield, and thus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. This is hard to understand if most SNe Ia explode when the primaries reach the Chandrasekhar mass. Finally, we test the findings of Gallagher et al. that the residuals of SNe Ia from the Hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxy metallicity, and we find no such correlation.},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars composed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators in establishing the acceleration of the universe’s expansion. However, the physics of the explosion are debated. Here we report a systematic spectral analysis of a large sample of well-observed type Ia supernovae. Mapping the velocity distribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical scenarios. We find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stable iron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova ejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of nickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product of incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in all supernovae, having an expansion velocity of {\textasciitilde}11,000 kilometers per second and corresponding to a mass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae considered here burned similar masses and suggests that their progenitors had the same mass. Synthetic light-curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion simulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly a delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae.},

We review the basics of SN rate measurement, preach about some sins of SN rate measurement and analysis, and illustrate one of these sins with an analogy about Martian scientists. We review the recent progress in measuring SN Ia rates in various environments and redshifts, and their use to reconstruct the SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) - the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation. A good number of DTD measurements, using a variety of methods, appear to be converging. At delays 1-1, power-law shape. The DTD peaks at the shortest delays probed. This result supports the idea of a double-degenerate progenitor origin for SNe Ia. Single-degenerate progenitors may still play a role in producing short-delay SNe Ia, or perhaps all SNe Ia, if the red-giant donor channel is more efficient than is found by most theoretical models. The DTD normalization enjoys fairly good agreement (though perhaps some tension), among the various measurements, with a Hubble time-integrated DTD value of about 2+/-1 SNe Ia per 1000Msolar (stellar mass formed with a low-mass turnover initial mass function). The local WD binary population suggests that the WD merger rate can explain the Galactic SN Ia rate, but only if sub-Chandra mergers lead to SN Ia events. We point to some future directions that should lead to progress in the field, including measurement of the bivariate (delay and stretch) SN Ia response function.},

We do so by combining previous measurements from the literature using a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibility that any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. We show that this method is robust to a wide variety of assumptions about the nature of problems in individual measurements or error estimates. Ultimately, our analysis yields an SFR for the Galaxy of \{\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}{\textbackslash}star \}=1.65+/- 0.19 \{\{M\}⊙ \} y\{\{r\}-1\}, assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). By combining HB methods with Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate the latest estimates of the Galactocentric radius of the Sun, R0, the exponential scale length of the disk, Ld, and the local surface density of stellar mass, \{\{Σ\}{\textbackslash}star \}(\{\{R\}0\}), we show that the mass of the Galactic bulge+bar is M{\textbackslash}star B=0.91+/- 0.07× \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}⊙ \}, the disk mass is M{\textbackslash}star D=5.17+/- 1.11× \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}⊙ \}, and their combination yields a total stellar mass of \{\{M\}{\textbackslash}star \}=6.08+/- 1.14× \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}⊙ \} (assuming a Kroupa IMF and an exponential disk profile). This analysis is based upon a new compilation of literature bulge mass estimates, normalized to common assumptions about the stellar IMF and Galactic disk properties, presented herein. We additionally find a bulge-to-total mass ratio for the Milky Way of B/T=0.150-0.019+0.028 and a specific SFR of \{\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}{\textbackslash}star \}/\{\{M\}{\textbackslash}star \}=2.71+/- 0.59× \{\{10\}-11\} yr-1.},

We show that the revised SFH also scales up the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as determined from the observed volumetric SN Ia rate history, aligning it with other field-galaxy SN Ia DTD measurements. The revised-SFH-based DTD has a form and a Hubble-time-integrated production efficiency of SNe Ia per of formed stellar mass. Using these revised histories and updated empirical iron yields of the various SN types, we re-derive the cosmic iron accumulation history. Core-collapse SNe and SNe Ia have contributed about equally to the total mass of iron in the universe today. We find the track of the average cosmic gas element in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance-ratio plane. The track is broadly similar to the observed main locus of Galactic stars in this plane, indicating a Milky Way (MW) SFH similar in form to the cosmic one. We easily find a simple MW SFH that makes the track closely match this stellar locus. Galaxy clusters appear to have a higher-normalization DTD. This cluster DTD, combined with a short-burst MW SFH peaked at z = 3, produces a track that matches remarkably well the observed “high-α” locus of MW stars, suggesting the halo/thick-disk population has had a galaxy-cluster-like formation mode. Thus, a simple two-component SFH, combined with empirical DTDs and SN iron yields, suffices to closely reproduce the MW’s stellar abundance patterns.},

	abstract = {We use chemistry ([alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H]), main sequence turnoff ages, and kinematics determined from H3 Survey spectroscopy and Gaia astrometry to identify the birth of the Galactic disk. We separate in-situ and accreted stars on the basis of angular momenta and eccentricities. The sequence of high-alpha in-situ stars persists down to at least [Fe/H]=-2.5 and shows unexpected non-monotonic behavior: with increasing metallicity the population first declines in [alpha/Fe], then increases over the range -1.3{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}-0.7, and then declines again at higher metallicities. The number of stars in the in-situ population rapidly increases above [Fe/H]=-1. The average kinematics of these stars are hot and independent of metallicity at [Fe/H]{\textless}-1 and then become increasingly cold and disk-like at higher metallicities. The ages of the in-situ, high-alpha stars are uniformly very old (13 Gyr) at [Fe/H]{\textless}-1.3, and span a wider range (8-12 Gyr) at higher metallicities. Interpreting the chemistry with a simple chemical evolution model suggests that the non-monotonic behavior is due to a significant increase in star formation efficiency, which began 13 Gyr ago. These results support a picture in which the first 1 Gyr of the Galaxy was characterized by a "simmering phase" in which the star formation efficiency was low and the kinematics had substantial disorder with some net rotation. The disk then underwent a dramatic transformation to a "boiling phase", in which the star formation efficiency increased substantially, the kinematics became disk-like, and the number of stars formed increased tenfold. We interpret this transformation as the birth of the Galactic disk at z{\textasciitilde}4. The physical origin of this transformation is unclear and does not seem to be reproduced in current galaxy formation models.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of radial flows on Galactic chemical evolution. A simple analytic scheme is developed prescribing the coupling of infall from the intergalactic medium and radial flows within the disc based on angular momentum conservation. We show that model parameters are tightly constrained by the observed [Fe/H]-abundance gradient in the Galactic disc. By this comparison the average rotational velocity of the onfalling material can be constrained to 0.7 ≤ v/Vc ≤ 0.75, or respectively ∼160 km s-1 when assuming a constant disc circular velocity of Vc = 220 km s-1. We test the robustness of this value against the influence of other processes. For a very simple model of inside-out formation this value changes only by Δv/Vc ∼ 0.1, i.e. ∼20 km s-1, and significantly less on more realistic scenarios, showing that inside-out formation does not alone explain the abundance gradient. Effects of other uncertain parameters, e.g. star formation history and star formation efficiency, have very small impact. Other drivers of inflow beyond our explicit modelling are assessed by adding a fixed inflow across the whole disc. The churning amplitude only mildly affects the results mostly by slightly flattening the metallicity gradient in the inner disc. A new process causing radial gas flows due to the ejection of material by stars moving on non-circular orbits is studied and seems to contribute negligibly to the total flows. We further show that gaseous outer discs cannot be the main source feeding the persistent star formation in the inner regions by a direct inflow.},

	abstract = {We present new analytic solutions for one-zone (fully mixed) chemical evolution models that incorporate a realistic delay time distribution for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and can therefore track the separate evolution of α-elements produced by core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and iron peak elements synthesized in both CCSNe and SNe Ia. Our solutions allow constant, exponential, or linear-exponential (\{\{te\}\}-t/\{τ \{sfh\}\}) star formation histories, or combinations thereof. In generic cases, α and iron abundances evolve to an equilibrium at which element production is balanced by metal consumption and gas dilution, instead of continuing to increase over time. The equilibrium absolute abundances depend principally on supernova yields and the outflow mass loading parameter η, while the equilibrium abundance ratio [α /\{Fe\}] depends mainly on yields and secondarily on star formation history. A stellar population can be metal-poor either because it has not yet evolved to equilibrium or because high outflow efficiency makes the equilibrium abundance itself low. Systems with ongoing gas accretion develop metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) that are sharply peaked, while “gas starved” systems with rapidly declining star formation, such as the conventional “closed box” model, have broadly peaked MDFs. A burst of star formation that consumes a significant fraction of a system’s available gas and retains its metals can temporarily boost [α /\{Fe\}] by 0.1-0.3 dex, a possible origin for rare, α-enhanced stars with intermediate age and/or high metallicity. Other sudden transitions in system properties can produce surprising behavior, including backward evolution of a stellar population from high to low metallicity.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the ages of the stars formed over a galaxy's lifetime is fundamental to an understanding of its formation and evolution. However, stellar ages are difficult to obtain since they cannot be measured from observations, but require comparison with stellar models1. Alternatively, age distributions can be derived by applying the robust technique of colour-magnitude diagram fitting2, which until now has been used primarily to study nearby galaxies. Accurate distances to individual Milky Way stars now provided by the Gaia spacecraft mission3 have allowed us to derive ages from a thick-disk colour-magnitude diagram and from the two-sequenced colour-magnitude diagram of the kinematically hot local halo4, whose blue sequence has been linked to a major accretion event, Gaia-Enceladus5,6. Because accurate stellar ages were lacking, the time of the merger and its role in our Galaxy's early evolution remained unclear. Here we show that the stars in both halo sequences share identical age distributions, and are older than most of the thick-disk stars. The sharp halo age distribution cutoff at ten billion years ago can be identified with the time of accretion of Gaia-Enceladus to the Milky Way. Together with state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy formation7, these robust ages allow us to order the early sequence of events that shaped our Galaxy. We identify the red-sequence stars as the first stars formed within the Milky Way progenitor, and their kinematics indicate that these stars constitute the long-sought in situ halo of the Milky Way.},

The data suggest that the stars in the thick and thin discs form two distinct sequences with the thick disc stars showing higher [α/Fe] ratios. We adopt two different approaches to model the evolution of thick and thin discs. In particular, we adopt (i) a two-infall approach where the thick disc forms fast and before the thin disc and by means of a fast gas accretion episode, whereas the thin disc forms by means of a second accretion episode on a longer time-scale; (ii) a parallel approach, where the two discs form in parallel but at different rates. By comparing our model results with the observed [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions in the two Galactic components, we conclude that the parallel approach can account for a group of α-enhanced metal-rich stars present in the data, whereas the two-infall approach cannot explain these stars unless they are the result of stellar migration. In both approaches, the thick disc has formed on a time-scale of accretion of 0.1 Gyr, whereas the thin disc formed on a time-scale of 7 Gyr in the solar region. In the two-infall approach, a gap in star formation between the thick and thin disc formation of several hundreds of Myr should be present, at variance with the parallel approach where no gap is present.},

	abstract = {In the first paper of this series, we present a new approach for studying the chemo-dynamical evolution in disk galaxies, which consists of fusing disk chemical evolution models with compatible numerical simulations of galactic disks. This method avoids known star formation and chemical enrichment problems encountered in simulations. Here we focus on the Milky Way, by using a detailed thin-disk chemical evolution model (matching local observables, which are weakly affected by radial migration) and a simulation in the cosmological context, with dynamical properties close to those of our Galaxy. We examine in detail the interplay between in situ chemical enrichment and radial migration and their impact on key observables in the solar neighborhood, e.g., the age-metallicity-velocity relation, the metallicity distribution, and gradients in the radial and vertical directions. We show that, due to radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the central bar at later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor high-[α/Fe] stars can reach the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a number of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite the fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant radial mixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is only weakly affected, with a scatter compatible with recent observational work. While we find a smooth density distribution in the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, we can recover the observed discontinuity by selecting particles according to kinematic criteria used in high-resolution samples to define the thin and thick disks. We outline a new method for estimating the birth place of the Sun and predict that the most likely radius lies in the range 4.4 {\textless} r {\textless} 7.7 kpc (for a current location at r = 8 kpc). A new, unifying model for the Milky Way thick disk is offered, where both mergers and radial migration play a role at different stages of the disk evolution. We show that in the absence of early-on massive mergers the vertical velocity dispersion of the oldest stars is underestimated by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 compared with observations. We can, therefore, argue that the Milky Way thick disk is unlikely to have been formed through a quiescent disk evolution. An observational test involving both chemical and kinematic information must be devised to ascertain this possibility. Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	abstract = {Stellar migration in Galactic disks has been the subject of several investigations in the past years. However, its impact on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way still needs to be fully quantified. In this paper, we aim to impose some constraints on the significance of this phenomenon by considering its influence on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way thin disk. We do not investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the migration of stars. Rather, we introduce a simple, heuristic treatment of stellar migration in a detailed chemical evolution model for the thin disk of the Milky Way, which already includes radial gas flows and reproduces several observational constraints for the solar vicinity and the whole Galactic disk. When stellar migration is implemented according to the results of chemo-dynamical simulations by Minchev et al. and finite stellar velocities of 1 km s-1 are taken into account, the high-metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution function of long-lived, thin-disk stars is well reproduced. By exploring the velocity space, we find that the migrating stars must travel with velocities in the range of 0.5-2 km s-1 to properly reproduce the high-metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution. We confirm previous findings by other authors that the observed spread in the age-metallicity relation of solar neighborhood stars can be explained by the presence of stars that originated at different Galactocentric distances, and we conclude that the chemical properties of stars currently observed in the solar vicinity do suggest that stellar migration is present to some extent.},

The majority of chemical evolution models assume that the Galactic disk forms by means of infall of gas and divide the disk into several independent rings without exchange of matter between them. However, if gas infall is important, radial gas flows should be taken into account as a dynamical consequence of infall. Aims: We test the effects of radial gas flows on detailed chemical evolution models (one-infall and two-infall) of the Milky Way disk with different prescriptions for the infall law and star formation rate. Methods: We modified the equation of chemical evolution to include radial gas flows according to the method described in Portinari \& Chiosi (2000, A\&A, 355, 929). Results: We found that with a gas radial inflow of constant speed the metallicity gradient tends to steepen. Taking into account a constant timescale for the infall rate along the Galaxy disk and radial flows with a constant speed, we obtained too flat a gradient, at variance with data, implying that an inside-out formation and/or a variable gas flow speed are required. To explain the observed gradients, the gas flow should increase in modulus with the galactocentric distance, in both the one-infall and two-infall models. However, the inside-out disk formation coupled with a threshold in the gas density (only in the two-infall model) for star formation and/or a variable efficiency of star formation with galactocentric distance can also reproduce the observed gradients without radial flows. Conclusions: We show that the radial flows can be the most important process in reproducing abundance gradients but only with a variable gas speed. Finally, one should consider that uncertainties in the data concerning gradients prevent us from drawing firm conclusions. Future more detailed data will help us to ascertain whether the radial flows are a necessary ingredient in the formation and evolution of the Galactic disk and disks in general.},

	abstract = {Context: The majority of galactic chemical evolution models assumes the instantaneous mixing approximation (IMA). This assumption is probably not realistic, as indicated by the existence of chemical inhomogeneities, although current chemical evolution models of the Milky Way can reproduce the majority of the observational constraints under the IMA. Aims: The aim of this paper is to test whether relaxing this approximation in a detailed chemical evolution model can improve or worsen the agreement with observations. To do that, we investigated two possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the “galactic fountain time delay effect” and ii) the “metal cooling time delay effect”. Methods: We considered various galactic fountain time delays for the chemical enrichment from massive stars. We then tested a time delay in the enrichment from stars of all masses due to gas cooling in the range 0.5-1 Gyr. Results: We found that the effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average time delay of 0.1 Gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed. Longer time delays produce differences in the results but they are not realistic. We also found that the O abundance gradient in the disk is not affected by galactic fountains. The metal cooling time delays produce strong effects on the evolution of the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields depending on metallicity. If, instead, the yields computed for the solar chemical composition are adopted, negligible effects are produced, as in the case of the galactic fountain delay. Conclusions: The relaxation of the IMA by means of the galactic fountain model, where the delay is considered only for massive stars and only in the disk, does not affect the chemical evolution results. The combination of metal dependent yields and time delay in the chemical enrichment from all stars starting from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance with observations.},

	abstract = {Aims: Our aim is to show how different hypotheses about type Ia supernova progenitors can affect Galactic chemical evolution. Supernovae Ia are believed to be the main producers of Fe and the timescale with which Fe is restored into the interstellar medium depends on the assumed supernova progenitor model. This is a way of selecting the most appropriate progenitor model for supernovae Ia, a still debated issue. Methods: We include different type Ia SN progenitor models, identified by their distribution of time delays, in a very detailed chemical evolution model for the Milky Way which follows the evolution of several chemical species. We test the single degenerate and the double degenerate models for supernova Ia progenitors, as well as other more empirical models based on differences in the time delay distributions. Results: We find that assuming the single degenerate or the double degenerate scenario produces negligible differences in the predicted [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation. On the other hand, assuming a percentage of prompt (exploding in the first 100 Myr) type Ia supernovae of 50\%, or that the maximum type Ia rate is reached after 3-4 Gyr from the beginning of star formation, as suggested by several authors, produces more noticeable effects on the [O/Fe] trend. However, given the spread still existing in the observational data, no model can be firmly excluded on the basis of only the [O/Fe] ratios. On the other hand, when the predictions of the different models are compared with the G-dwarf metallicity distribution, the scenarios with very few prompt type Ia supernovae can be excluded. Conclusions: Models including the single degenerate or double degenerate scenario with a percentage of 10-13\% of prompt type Ia supernovae produce results in very good agreement with the observations. A fraction of prompt type Ia supernovae larger than 30\% worsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no prompt type Ia supernovae are allowed. In particular, two empirical models for the type Ia SN progenitors can be excluded: the one without prompt type Ia supernovae and the one assuming a delay time distribution that is ∝t-0.5. We conclude that the typical timescale for the Fe enrichment in the Milky Way is around 1-1.5 Gyr and that type Ia supernovae already should appear during the halo phase.},

	abstract = {We discuss the evolution of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in galaxies of different morphological type by adopting detailed chemical evolution models with different star formation histories (continuous star formation or starbursts). In all the models detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions from supernovae of all types and low- and intermediate-mass stars are taken into account. We start by computing chemical evolution models for the Milky Way with different stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions. Then, a comparison between model results and `key' observational constraints allows us to choose the best set of stellar yields. Once the best set of yields is identified for the Milky Way, we apply the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions to other spirals (in particular M101) and dwarf irregular galaxies. We compare our model predictions with the [C,N,O/Fe] versus [Fe/H], log(C/O) versus 12 + log(O/H), log(N/O) versus 12+ log(O/H) and [C/O] versus [Fe/H] relations observed in the solar vicinity and draw the following conclusions. (i) There is no need to invoke strong stellar winds in massive stars in order to explain the evolution of the C/O ratio, as often claimed in the literature. (ii) The predicted [O/Fe] ratio as a function of metallicity is in very good agreement with the most recent data available for the solar vicinity, especially for halo stars. This fact again suggests that the oxygen stellar yields in massive stars computed by either Woosley \& Weaver or Thielemann, Nomoto \& Hashimoto without taking into account mass loss, reproduce the observations well. (iii) We predict that the gap observed in the [Fe/O] versus [O/H] at [O/H]{\textasciitilde}-0.3 dex should be observed also in C/O versus O/H. The existence of such a gap is predicted by our model for the Milky Way and is caused by a halt in the star formation between the end of the thick disc and the beginning of the thin disc phase. Such a halt is produced by the adopted threshold gas density for the star formation rate. (iv) This threshold is also responsible for the prediction of a very slow chemical enrichment between the time of formation of the solar system (4.5 Gyr ago) and the present time, in agreement with new abundance measurements. (v) The chemical evolution models for dwarf irregulars and spirals, adopting the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions of the best model for the solar neighbourhood, well reproduce the available constraints for these objects. (vi) By taking into account the results obtained for all the studied galaxies (Milky Way, M101, dwarf galaxies and DLAs) we conclude that there is no need for claiming a strong primary component of N produced in massive stars (M {\textgreater} 10 Msolar). (vii) Moreover, there is a strong indication that C and N are mainly produced in low- and intermediate-mass stars, at variance with recent suggestions that most of the C should come from massive stars. In particular, intermediate-mass stars with masses between 4 and 8 Msolar contribute mostly to N (both primary and secondary) whereas those with masses between 1 and 3 Msolar contribute mostly to C. At the same time, our results suggest that the C yields computed for massive stars, without taking into account stellar rotation, are underestimated and should be at least a factor of 3 larger than the current values.},

We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available. Our model fits these new data very well. The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that, in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of {\textless}=1 Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation in the solar vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of the disk (R {\textless} 1 R⊙) are steeper than in the outer regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of the star formation process are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we adopt a chemical evolution model, which is an improved version of the Chiappini, Matteucci, \& Gratton model, assuming two main accretion episodes for the formation of the Galaxy, the first forming the halo and bulge in a short timescale and the second one forming the thin disk, with a timescale that is an increasing function of the Galactocentric distance (being of the order of 7 Gyrs at the solar neighborhood). The present model takes into account in more detail than previously the halo density distribution and explores the effects of a threshold density in the star formation process during both the halo and disk phases. The model also includes the most recent nucleosynthesis prescriptions concerning supernovae of all types, novae, and single stars dying as white dwarfs. In the comparison between model predictions and available data, we have focused our attention on abundance gradients as well as gas, stellar, and star formation rate distributions along the disk, since this kind of model has already proven to be quite successful in reproducing the solar neighborhood characteristics. We suggest that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves detectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer regions of the disk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almost completely disentangled. This is due to the fact that the halo and disk densities are comparable at large Galactocentric distances and therefore the gas lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer disk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for the star formation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is necessary to reproduce the majority of observational data in the solar vicinity and in the whole disk. In particular, a threshold in the star formation implies the occurrence of a gap in the star formation at the halo-disk transition phase, in agreement with recent data. We conclude that a relatively short halo formation timescale ({\textasciitilde}=0.8 Gyr), in agreement with recent estimates for the age differences among Galactic globular clusters, coupled with an ``inside-out'' formation of the Galactic disk, where the innermost regions are assumed to have formed much faster than the outermost ones, represents, at the moment, the most likely explanation for the formation of the Milky Way. This scenario allows us to predict abundance gradients and other radial properties of the Galactic disk in very good agreement with observations. Moreover, as a consequence of the adopted ``inside-out'' scenario for the disk, we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk must have increased with time and that the average {\textless}[α/Fe]{\textgreater} ratios in stars (halo plus disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 kpcs from the Galactic center. We also show that the same ratios increase substantially toward the outermost disk regions and the expected scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because the outermost regions are dominated by halo stars. More observations at large Galactocentric distances are needed to test these predictions.},

	abstract = {The existence of high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ stars with inferred ages {\textless} 6 Gyr has been confirmed recently with large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. However, stellar mergers or binary interactions can induce properties associated with young ages, such as high mass, rapid rotation, or high activity, even in old populations. Literature studies have confirmed that at least some of these apparently young stars are old merger products. However, none have ruled out the possibility of genuinely young high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ stars. Because cool GKM dwarfs spin down, rapid rotation can be used to indicate youth. In this paper, we provide strong evidence that truly young high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ stars exist by studying high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ rotators in the Kepler and K2 field with abundance measurements from GALAH and APOGEE. After excluding close binaries using radial velocity (RV) measurements from Gaia DR3 and multi-epoch RVs from APOGEE, we find a total of 70 high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ rapid rotators with periods {\textasciitilde}10-30 days, 29 of which have lithium measurements from GALAH, indicating that they have not gone through past mass transfer or stellar merger events. We identify 10 young high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ candidates with no signs of merger-induced mixing or close companions. One clear example is a G dwarf with a measurable rotation and an age of 1.98\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.28\}\$ Gyr that is likely a single star with multiple RV measurements from APOGEE, has significant lithium detection from GALAH (A(Li) = 1.79), and has no signs of planet engulfment.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and low-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and low-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}] versus [{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/H], confirming previous suggestions. We then try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking into account also the possible accretion of dwarf satellites.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}] versus [{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/H] exhibit a sharp increase in [Fe/{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}] at a nearly constant [{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/H] (where {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}] versus [{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. The revised version of the two-infall chemical evolution model proposed in this study reproduces the APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios better than before. Particularly noteworthy is the model’s ability to predict the hiatus in the star formation between the two infalls of gas, which form the thick and thin disc, respectively, and thus generate abundance ratios compatible with APOGEE DR17 data.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We show that the signature of a hiatus in the star formation is imprinted in the APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios. A chemical model predicting a pause in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and in which the high-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy, could well explain the observations},

	abstract = {Metallicities of both gas and stars decline toward large radii in spiral galaxies, a trend known as the radial metallicity gradient. We quantify the evolution of the metallicity gradient in the Milky Way as traced by APOGEE red giants with age estimates from machine learning algorithms. Stars up to ages of \${\textbackslash}sim\$9 Gyr follow a similar relation between metallicity and Galactocentric radius. This constancy challenges current models of Galactic chemical evolution, which typically predict lower metallicities for older stellar populations. Our results favor an equilibrium scenario, in which the gas-phase gradient reaches a nearly constant normalization early in the disk lifetime. Using a fiducial choice of parameters, we demonstrate that one possible origin of this behavior is an outflow that more readily ejects gas from the interstellar medium with increasing Galactocentric radius. A direct effect of the outflow is that baryons do not remain in the interstellar medium for long, which causes the ratio of star formation to accretion, \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}star / {\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{in\}\$, to quickly become constant. This ratio is closely related to the local equilibrium metallicity, since its numerator and denominator set the rates of metal production by stars and hydrogen gained through accretion, respectively. Building in a merger event results in a perturbation that evolves back toward the equilibrium state on \${\textbackslash}sim\$Gyr timescales. Under the equilibrium scenario, the radial metallicity gradient is not a consequence of the inside-out growth of the disk but instead reflects a trend of declining \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}star / {\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{in\}\$ with increasing Galactocentric radius.},

We use a recent measurement of the mean iron yield of core collapse supernovae (CCSN) by Rodriguez et al., , to infer the scale of α-element yields by assuming that the plateau of [α/Fe] abundance ratios observed in low-metallicity stars represents the yield ratio of CCSN. For a plateau at [α/Fe]cc = 0.45, we find that the population-averaged yields of O and Mg are about equal to the solar abundance of these elements, , where is the mass of element X produced by massive stars per unit mass of star formation. The inferred O and Fe yields agree with predictions of the Sukhbold et al. CCSN models assuming their Z9.6+N20 neutrino-driven engine, a scenario in which many progenitors with M {\textless} 40M ⊙ implode to black holes rather than exploding. The yields are lower than assumed in many models of the galaxy mass–metallicity relation, reducing the level of outflows needed to match observed abundances. Our one-zone chemical evolution models with evolve to solar metallicity at late times. By further requiring that models reach [α/Fe] ≈ 0 at late times, we infer a Hubble-time integrated Type Ia supernova rate of , compatible with estimates from supernova surveys.},

The chemical composition of the Sun is required in the context of various studies in astrophysics, among them in the calculation of standard solar models (SSMs) used to describe the evolution of the Sun from the pre-main-sequence to its present age. Aims: In this work, we provide a critical re-analysis of the solar chemical abundances and corresponding SSMs. Methods: For the photospheric values, we employed new high-quality solar observational data collected with the IAG facility, state-of-the art non-equilibrium modelling, new oscillator strengths, and different atmospheric models, including the MARCS model, along with averages based on Stagger and CO5BOLD 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of stellar convection. We performed new calculations of oscillator strengths for transitions in O I and N I. For O I, which is a critical element with regard to the interior models, calculations were carried out using several independent methods. We investigated our results in comparison with the previous estimates. Results: We find an unprecedented agreement between the new estimates of transition probabilities, thus supporting our revised solar oxygen abundance value. We also provide new estimates of the noble gas Ne abundance. In addition, we discuss the consistency of our photospheric measurements with meteoritic values, taking into account the systematic and correlated errors. Finally, we provide revised chemical abundances, leading to a new value proposed for the solar photospheric present-day metallicity of Z/X = 0.0225, which we then employed in SSM calculations. We find that the puzzling mismatch between the helioseismic constraints on the solar interior structure and the model can be resolved thanks to this new chemical composition.},

This explosion model has been calibrated to give the observed energy for SN 1987A, using five standard progenitors, and for the Crab SN using a 9.6 \{M\}⊙ progenitor. As a result of using a calibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the SN is variable and sensitive to the structure of each pre-SN star. Many progenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black holes (BHs), and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set. The resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the Sun provided that a reasonable contribution from SNe Ia is also allowed, but with a deficiency of light s-process isotopes. The resulting neutron star initial mass function has a mean gravitational mass near 1.4 \{M\}⊙ . The average BH mass is about 9 \{M\}⊙ if only the helium core implodes, and 14 \{M\}⊙ if the entire pre-SN star collapses.

In each bin of [Fe/H] and Galactocentric radius R, we model p([α/Fe]) as a sum of two Gaussians, representing 'low-α' and 'high-α' populations with scale heights \$z\_1=0.45{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\$ and \$z\_2=0.95{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\$, respectively. By accounting for age-dependent and z-dependent selection effects in APOGEE, we infer the [α/Fe] distributions that would be found for a fair sample of long-lived stars covering all z. Near the Solar circle, this distribution is bimodal at sub-solar [Fe/H], with the low-α and high-α peaks clearly separated by a minimum at intermediate [α/Fe]. In agreement with previous results, we find that the high-α population is more prominent at smaller R, lower [Fe/H], and larger {\textbar}z{\textbar}, and that the sequence separation is smaller for Si and Ca than for Mg, O, and S. We find significant intrinsic scatter in [α/Fe] at fixed [Fe/H] for both the low-α and high-α populations, typically {\textasciitilde}0.04-dex. The means, dispersions, and relative amplitudes of this two-Gaussian description, and the dependence of these parameters on R, [Fe/H], and α-element, provide a quantitative target for chemical evolution models and a test for hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxy formation. We argue that explaining the observed bimodality will probably require one or more sharp transitions in the disk's gas accretion, star formation, or outflow history in addition to radial mixing of stellar populations.},

We perform careful selection of open cluster stars excluding those that may be affected by biases in spectral analysis. The cleaned open clusters sample is compared with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, using well tested stellar yields and prescription for radial migration. Different scenarios of Galaxy evolution are tested to explain the data, i.e. the two-infall and the three-infall frameworks, suggesting that the chemical thin disk is formed by one or two subsequent gas accretion episodes, respectively. Results. With the performed selection in cluster stars, we still find a metallicity decrease between intermediate age (1{\textless}Age/Gyr{\textless}3) and young (Age{\textless}1Gyr) open clusters. This decrease cannot be explained in the context of the two-infall scenario, even by accounting for the effect of migration and yield prescriptions. The three-infall model, with its late gas accretion in the last 3 Gyr, can explain the low metallic content in young clusters. However, we invoke a milder metal dilution relative to previous findings. Conclusions. To explain the observed low metallic content in young clusters, we propose that a late gas accretion episode triggering metal dilution should have taken place, extending the framework of the three-infall model for the first time to the entire Galactic disk.},

	abstract = {Context. The [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios are a fundamental fossil signature used to trace the chemical evolution of the disc and to divide it into low-α and high-α populations. Despite the huge observational and theoretical efforts, discrepancies between models and data are still present and several explanations have been put forward to explain the [α/Fe] bimodality. Aims: In this work we take advantage of a new AMBRE:HARPS dataset, which provides new more precise [Mg/Fe] estimations and reliable stellar ages for a subsample of stars, to study the [α/Fe] bimodality and the evolution of the solar neighbourhood. Methods: The data are compared with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, exploring the most used prescriptions for stellar yields and different formation scenarios for the Galactic disc (i.e. the delayed two-infall and the parallel models), including prescriptions for stellar radial migration. Results: We see that most of the stellar yield prescriptions struggle to reproduce the observed trend of the data and that semi-empirical yields describe best the [Mg/Fe] evolution in the thick and thin discs. In particular, most of the yields still predict a steeper decrease of the [Mg/Fe] ratio at high metallicity than shown by the data. The bulk of the data are well reproduced by the parallel and two-infall scenarios, but both scenarios have problems in explaining the most metal-rich and metal-poor tails of the low-α data. These tails can be explained in light of radial migration from the inner and outer disc regions, respectively. Conclusions: Despite the evidence of stellar migration, it is difficult to estimate the actual contribution of stars from other parts of the disc to the solar vicinity in the data we adopt. However, the comparison between data and models suggests that peculiar histories of star formation, such as that of the two-infall model, are still needed to reproduce the observed distribution of stars.

	abstract = {Context. The recent Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) represents an unparalleled revolution in Galactic archaeology, providing numerous radial velocities and chemical abundances for millions of stars as well as all-sky coverage. Aims We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galactic disc components (high- and low- α sequence stars) designed to reproduce the new abundance ratios provided by the General Stellar Parametriser-spectroscopy module for the Gaia DR3 and constrained by the detailed star formation (SF) histories for both the thick and thin disc stars inferred from previous Gaia releases. Methods: Sophisticated modelling based on previous Gaia releases have found evidence for narrow episodes of enhanced SF inferred in recent time. Additionally, Gaia DR3 indicated the presence of young (massive) low-α disc stars that show evidence of a recent chemical impoverishment in several elements. In order to reproduce these observables, we propose a new chemical evolution model in which the low-α sequence is generated by two distinct infall episodes. Hence, in this study we compare Gaia DR3 chemical abundances with the predictions of a three-infall chemical evolution model for the high- and low-α components. Results The proposed three-infall chemical evolution model nicely reproduces the main features of the abundance ratio [X/Fe] versus [M/H] (X=Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, α) of Gaia DR3 stars in different age bins for the considered α elements. Moreover, the most recent gas infall - which started ∼2.7 Gyr ago - allowed us to predict accurately predict the Gaia DR3 young population which has experienced a recent chemical impoverishment. Conclusions: We extended previous chemical evolution models designed to reproduce APOGEE and APOKASC data in order to predict new Gaia DR3 chemical abundances. To this aim, we proposed a three-infall chemical evolution model to better trace both (i) the young population in Gaia DR3 with evidence of chemical impoverishment and (ii) the SF history from previous Gaia releases.},

	abstract = {Context. Classical Cepheids (CCs) are solid distance indicators and tracers of young stellar populations. Dating back to the beginning of the 20th century, they have been safely adopted to trace the rotation, kinematics, and chemical enrichment history of the Galactic thin disk. Aims: The main aim of this investigation is to provide iron, oxygen, and sulfur abundances for the largest and most homogeneous sample of Galactic CCs analyzed so far (1118 spectra of 356 objects). The current sample, containing 70 CCs for which spectroscopic metal abundances are provided for the first time, covers a wide range in galactocentric distances, pulsation modes, and pulsation periods. Methods: Optical high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio that were collected with different spectrographs were adopted to provide homogeneous estimates of the atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and microturbulent velocity) that are required to determine the abundance. Individual distances were based either on trigonometric parallaxes by the Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) or on distances based on near-infrared period-luminosity relations. Results: We found that iron and α-element radial gradients based on CCs display a well-defined change in the slope for galactocentric distances larger than {\textasciitilde}12 kpc. We also found that logarithmic regressions account for the variation in [X/H] abundances from the inner to the outer disk. Radial gradients for the same elements, but based on open clusters covering a wide range in cluster ages, display similar trends. This means that the flattening in the outer disk is an intrinsic feature of the radial gradients because it is independent of age. Empirical evidence indicates that the S radial gradient is steeper than the Fe radial gradient. The difference in the slope is a factor of two in the linear fit (−0.081 vs. −0.041 dex kpc−1) and changes from −1.62 to −0.91 in the logarithmic distance. Moreover, we found that S (explosive nucleosynthesis) is underabundant on average when compared with O (hydrostatic nucleosynthesis). The difference becomes clearer in the metal-poor regime and for the [O/Fe] and [S/Fe] abundance ratios. We performed a detailed comparison with Galactic chemical evolution models and found that a constant star formation efficiency for galactocentric distances larger than 12 kpc accounts for the flattening observed in both iron and α-elements. To further constrain the impact of the predicted S yields for massive stars on radial gradients, we adopted a toy model and found that the flattening in the outermost regions requires a decrease of a factor of four in the current S predictions. Conclusions: CCs are solid beacons for tracing the recent chemical enrichment of young stellar populations. Sulfur photospheric abundances, when compared with other α-elements, have the key advantage of being a volatile element. Therefore, stellar S abundances can be directly compared with nebular sulfur abundances in external galaxies.

	abstract = {We compare the observed turbulent pressure in molecular gas, Pturb, to the required pressure for the interstellar gas to stay in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of a galaxy, PDE. To do this, we combine arcsecond resolution CO data from PHANGS-ALMA with multiwavelength data that trace the atomic gas, stellar structure, and star formation rate (SFR) for 28 nearby star-forming galaxies. We find that Pturb correlates with - but almost always exceeds - the estimated PDE on kiloparsec scales. This indicates that the molecular gas is overpressurized relative to the large-scale environment. We show that this overpressurization can be explained by the clumpy nature of molecular gas; a revised estimate of PDE on cloud scales, which accounts for molecular gas self-gravity, external gravity, and ambient pressure, agrees well with the observed Pturb in galaxy disks. We also find that molecular gas with cloud-scale Pturb ≈ PDE ≳ 105 kB K cm-3 in our sample is more likely to be self-gravitating, whereas gas at lower pressure it appears more influenced by ambient pressure and/or external gravity. Furthermore, we show that the ratio between Pturb and the observed SFR surface density, ΣSFR, is compatible with stellar feedback-driven momentum injection in most cases, while a subset of the regions may show evidence of turbulence driven by additional sources. The correlation between ΣSFR and kpc-scale PDE in galaxy disks is consistent with the expectation from self-regulated star formation models. Finally, we confirm the empirical correlation between molecular-to-atomic gas ratio and kpc-scale PDE reported in previous works.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new model for the structure and evolution of the gas in galactic discs. In the model the gas is in vertical pressure and energy balance. Star formation feedback injects energy and momentum, and non-axisymmetric torques prevent the gas from becoming more than marginally gravitationally unstable. From these assumptions we derive the relationship between galaxies' bulk properties (gas surface density, stellar content, and rotation curve) and their star formation rates, gas velocity dispersions, and rates of radial inflow. We show that the turbulence in discs can be powered primarily by star formation feedback, radial transport, or a combination of the two. In contrast to models that omit either radial transport or star formation feedback, the predictions of this model yield excellent agreement with a wide range of observations, including the star formation law measured in both spatially resolved and unresolved data, the correlation between galaxies' star formation rates and velocity dispersions, and observed rates of radial inflow. The agreement holds across a wide range of galaxy mass and type, from local dwarfs to extreme starbursts to high-redshift discs. We apply the model to galaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and show that it predicts a transition from mostly gravity-driven turbulence at high redshift to star-formation-driven turbulence at low redshift. This transition and the changes in mass transport rates that it produces naturally explain why galaxy bulges tend to form at high redshift and discs at lower redshift, and why galaxies tend to quench inside-out.},

We find that accretion disks with typical rates in AGNs can be driven by SNexp in the regions and metals are produced spontaneously. The present model predicts a metallicity-luminosity relationship consistent with that observed in AGNs. As relics of SF regions, a ring (or belt) consisting of old stars remains for every episode of supermassive black hole activity.

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the high metallicity generally observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and quasars originates from ongoing star formation in the self-gravitating part of accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We designate this region as the star-forming (SF) disk, in which metals are produced from supernova explosions (SNexp) while at the same time inflows are driven by SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the SMBHs. In this paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection is established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk. We find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different positions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves for steady-state AGNs. Metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can be used as a probe of the SF disk age during one episode of SMBH activity. In the SF disk, evaporation of molecular clouds heated by SNexp blast waves unavoidably forms hot gas. This heating is eventually balanced by the cooling of the hot gas, but we show that the hot gas will escape from the SF disk before being cooled, and diffuse into the broad-line regions (BLRs) forming with a typical rate of {\textasciitilde}1 M sun yr-1. The diffusion of hot gas from an SF disk depends on ongoing star formation, leading to the metallicity gradients in BLR observed in AGNs. We discuss this and other observable consequences of this scenario.},

Most galaxies show radial flows of only a few km s-1 throughout their H I disks, either inward or outward, without any clear increase in magnitude in the outermost regions, as we would expect for continuous radial accretion. Gas mass flow rates for most galaxies are less than 1 M ⊙ yr-1. Over the entire sample, we estimated an average inflow rate of 0.3 M ⊙ yr-1 outside the optical disk and of 0.1 M ⊙ yr-1 in the outskirts of the H I disks. These inflow rates are about 5-10 times smaller than the average star formation rate of 1.4 M ⊙ yr-1.

To assist in interpreting the data, we present detailed modeling that demonstrates the effects of bar streaming, inflow, and a warp on the observed Fourier components. We find in all of the galaxies evidence for either elliptical streaming or a warped disk over some range in radius, with deviations from pure circular rotation at the level of {\textasciitilde}20-60 km s-1. Evidence for kinematic warps is observed in several cases well inside R25. No unambiguous evidence for radial inflows is seen in any of the seven galaxies, and we are able to place an upper limit of {\textasciitilde}5-10 km s-1 (3\%-5\% of the circular speed) on the magnitude of any radial inflow in the inner regions of NGC 4414, NGC 5033, and NGC 5055.

Our simulated galaxy disc qualitatively reproduces the variation of the dichotomy in [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] at different Galactocentric distances as derived by APOGEE-DR16, as well as the stellar age distribution in [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] from APOKASC-2. The disc grows from the inside out, with a radial gradient in the star-formation rate during the entire phase. Despite the radial dependence, the outflow-to-infall ratio of metals in our simulated halo shows a time-independent profile scaling with the disc growth. The simulated disc undergoes two modes of gas inflow: (I) an infall of metal-poor and relatively low-[α/Fe] gas, and (II) a radial flow where already chemically enriched gas moves inwards with an average velocity of ∼0.7 km s-1. Moreover, we find that stellar migrations mostly happen outwards, on typical time-scales of ∼5 Gyr. Our predicted radial metallicity gradients agree with the observations from APOGEE-DR16, and the main effect of stellar migrations is to flatten the radial metallicity profiles by 0.05 dex/kpc in the slopes. We also show that the effect of migrations can appear more important in [α/Fe] than in the [Fe/H]-age relation of thin-disc stars.},

	abstract = {We compute the abundance gradients along the disc of the Milky Way by means of the two-infall model: in particular, the gradients of oxygen and iron and their temporal evolution. First, we explore the effects of several physical processes which influence the formation and evolution of abundance gradients. They are (i) the inside-out formation of the disc, (ii) a threshold in the gas density for star formation, (iii) a variable star formation efficiency along the disc, (iv) radial flows and their speed and (v) different total surface mass density (gas plus stars) distributions for the halo. We are able to reproduce at best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-out formation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formation along the disc and radial gas flows. It is particularly important the choice of the velocity pattern for radial flows and the combination of this velocity pattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo. Having selected the best model, we then explore the evolution of abundance gradients in time and find that the gradients in general steepen in time and that at redshift z ∼ 3 there is a gradient inversion in the inner regions of the disc, in the sense that at early epochs the oxygen abundance decreases towards the Galactic Centre. This effect, which has been observed, is naturally produced by our models if an inside-out formation of the disc and a constant star formation efficiency are assumed. The inversion is due to the fact that in the inside-out formation a strong infall of primordial gas, contrasting chemical enrichment, is present in the innermost disc regions at early times. The gradient inversion remains also in the presence of radial flows, either with constant or variable speed in time, and this is a new result.},

	abstract = {We study the radial transport of cold gas within simulated disk galaxies at cosmic noon, aiming at distinguishing between disk instability and accretion along cold streams from the cosmic web as its driving mechanism. Disks are selected based on kinematics and flattening from the VELA zoom-in hydro-cosmological simulations. The radial velocity fields in the disks are mapped, their averages are computed as a function of radius and over the whole disk, and the radial mass flux in each disk as a function of radius is obtained. The transport directly associated with fresh incoming streams is identified by selecting cold gas cells that are either on incoming streamlines or have low metallicity. The radial velocity fields in VELA disks are found to be highly non-axisymmetric, showing both inflows and outflows. However, in most cases, the average radial velocities, both as a function of radius and over the whole disk, are directed inwards, with the disk-averaged radial velocities typically amounting to a few percent of the disk-averaged rotational velocities. This is significantly lower than the expectations from various models that analytically predict the inward mass transport as driven by torques associated with disk instability. Under certain simplifying assumptions, the latter typically predict average inflows of more than \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the rotational velocities. Analyzing the radial motions of streams and off-stream material, we find that the radial inflow in VELA disks is dominated by the stream inflows themselves, especially in the outer disks. The high inward radial velocities inferred in observed disks at cosmic noon, at the level of \${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}! 20{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the rotational velocities, may reflect inflowing streams from the cosmic web rather than being generated by disk instability.},

We present spatially resolved chemical and dynamical properties for a sample of 26 galaxies at \$0.5 {\textbackslash}lesssim z {\textbackslash}lesssim 1.7\$ from the MSA-3D survey. These innovative observations provide 3D spectroscopy of galaxies at a spatial resolution approaching JWST's diffraction limit and a high spectral resolution of \$R{\textbackslash}simeq2700\$. The metallicity gradients measured in our galaxy sample range from \$-\$0.05 to 0.02 dex{\textasciitilde}kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Most galaxies exhibit negative or flat radial gradients, indicating lower metallicity in the outskirts or uniform metallicity throughout the entire galaxy. We confirm a tight relationship between stellar mass and metallicity gradient at \$z{\textbackslash}sim1\$ with small intrinsic scatter of 0.02 dex{\textasciitilde}kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Our results indicate that metallicity gradients become increasingly negative as stellar mass increases, likely because the more massive galaxies tend to be more "disky". This relationship is consistent with the predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with strong stellar feedback. This work presents the effort to harness the multiplexing capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA in slit-stepping mode to map the chemical and kinematic profiles of high-redshift galaxies in large samples and at high spatial and spectral resolution.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

The list of tracked isotopes automatically adapts to the complete set provided by the input yields. The present iteration of GalCEM tracks 86 elements broken down into 451 isotopes. The prescription includes massive stars, low-to-intermediate-mass stars, and Type Ia supernovae as enrichment channels. We have developed a preprocessing tool that extracts multidimensional interpolation curves from the input yield tables. These interpolation curves improve the computation speeds of the full convolution integrals, which are computed for each isotope and for each enrichment channel. We map the integrand quantities onto consistent array grids in order to perform the numerical integration at each time step. The differential equation is solved with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. We constrain our analysis to the evolution of all light and intermediate elements from carbon to zinc, and lithium. Our results are consistent up to the extremely metal-poor regime with Galactic abundances. We provide tools to track the mass rate change of individual isotopes on a typical spiral galaxy with a final baryonic mass of 5 × 1010 M ⊙. Future iterations of the work will extend to the full periodic table by including the enrichment from neutron-capture channels as well as spatially dependent treatments of galaxy properties.

It is assumed that the disk forms by accretion of primordial material coming from outside with a time-scale which is a function of the galactocentric distance. The possibility of forming the disk out of enriched halo gas is also studied in a simple way. The evolution of the abundances of several single elements is predicted as well as that of gas mass, SN rates and star formation rate, both in the solar neighborhood and in the whole disk, under different assumptions for the star formation rate. Abundance gradients along the galactic disk are well reproduced and a possible interpretation for the differences among gradients of different elements is given in terms of nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes. This interpretation can represent a key for understanding gradients also in external galaxies. In particular, a natural explanation is suggested for the positive gradient of S/O, found in M101 and M33.},

	abstract = {The major uncertainties involved in the Chandrasekhar mass models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are related to the companion star of their accreting white dwarf progenitor (which determines the accretion rate and consequently the carbon ignition density) and the flame speed after the carbon ignition. We calculate explosive nucleosynthesis in relatively slow deflagrations with a variety of deflagration speeds and ignition densities to put new constraints on the above key quantities. The abundance of the Fe group, in particular of neutron-rich species like 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, 54,58Fe, and 58Ni, is highly sensitive to the electron captures taking place in the central layers. The yields obtained from such a slow central deflagration, and from a fast deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and put to comparison with solar isotopic abundances. To avoid excessively large ratios of 54Cr/56Fe and 50Ti/56Fe, the central density of the ''average'' white dwarf progenitor at ignition should be as low as {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2×109 g cm-3. To avoid the overproduction of 58Ni and 54Fe, either the flame speed should not exceed a few percent of the sound speed in the central low Ye layers or the metallicity of the average progenitors has to be lower than solar. Such low central densities can be realized by a rapid accretion as fast as Ṁ{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1×10-7 Msolar yr-1. In order to reproduce the solar abundance of 48Ca, one also needs progenitor systems that undergo ignition at higher densities. Even the smallest laminar flame speeds after the low-density ignitions would not produce sufficient amount of this isotope. We also found that the total amount of 56Ni, the Si-Ca/Fe ratio, and the abundance of some elements like Mn and Cr (originating from incomplete Si burning), depend on the density of the deflagration-detonation transition in delayed detonations. Our nucleosynthesis results favor transition densities slightly below 2.2×107 g cm-3.},

Altogether 78 different model supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity (typically 1.2 × 1051 ergs), and the explosive modifications to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined. A single value of the critical 12C(α,γ) 16O reaction rate corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations. The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant is also determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a "mass cut" farther out. This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 Msun will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail, they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because of their more compact structure and reduced mass loss.},

To best fit the data in the solar neighborhood, when adopting the Woosley \& Weaver (1995, ApJS, 101, 181) yields for massive stars and the Iwamoto et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{Iwamoto99\}, ApJS, 125, 439) ones for type Ia SNe, it is required that: i) the Mg yields should be increased in stars with masses from 11 to 20 M⊙ and decreased in masses larger than 20 M⊙. The Mg yield should be also increased in SNe Ia. ii) The Si yields should be slightly increased in stars above 40 M⊙, whereas those of Ti should be increased between 11 and 20 M⊙ and above 30 M⊙. iii) The Cr and Mn yields should be increased in stars with masses in the range 11-20 M⊙; iv) the Co yields in SNe Ia should be larger and smaller in stars in the range 11-20 M⊙; v) the Ni yield from type Ia SNe should be decreased; vi) the Zn yield from type Ia SNe should be increased. vii) The yields of O (metallicity dependent SN models), Ca, Fe, Ni, and Zn (the solar abundance case) in massive stars from Woosley \& Weaver ({\textbackslash}cite\{Woosley95\}) are the best to fit the abundance patterns of these elements since they do not need any changes.

The predictions of our model are compared with data from the sixth data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, from which we consider 62 open clusters with age ≳ 0.1 Gyr and {\textasciitilde}1300 Milky Way disc field stars. We conclude that: (i) the [Eu/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram is reproduced by both prompt and delayed sources, with the prompt source dominating Eu production; (ii) rotation in massive stars significantly contributes to the first peak s-process elements, but MNS and MR-SNe are necessary to match the observations; and (iii) our model slightly underpredicts Mo and Nd, while accurately reproducing the [Pr/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend. Regarding the radial gradients, we find that: (i) our predicted [Fe/H] gradient slope agrees with observations from Gaia-ESO and other high-resolution spectroscopic surveys; (ii) the predicted [Eu/H] radial gradient slope is steeper than the observed one, regardless of how quick the production of Eu is, prompting discussion on different Galaxy-formation scenarios and stellar radial migration effects; and (iii) elements in the second s-process peak as well as Nd and Pr exhibit a plateau at low-Galactocentric distances, likely due to enhanced enrichment from LIMS in the inner regions.},

Our best chemical evolution model for Enceladus nicely fits the observed stellar [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance trends, and reproduces the observed stellar metallicity distribution function, by assuming low star formation efficiency, fast infall time-scale, and mild outflow intensity. We predict a median age for Enceladus stars 12.33{\textasciicircum}\{+0.92\}\_\{-1.36\} Gyr, and - at the time of the merger with our Galaxy (≈10 Gyr ago from Helmi et al.) - we predict for Enceladus a total stellar mass M⋆ ≈ 5 × 109 M{\textbackslash}odot. By looking at the predictions of our best model, we discuss that merger events between the Galaxy and systems like Enceladus may have inhibited the gas accretion on to the Galaxy disc at high redshifts, heating up the gas in the halo. This scenario could explain the extended period of quenching in the star formation activity of our Galaxy about 10 Gyr ago, which is predicted by Milky Way chemical evolution models, in order to reproduce the observed bimodality in [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] between thick- and thin-disc stars.},

	abstract = {The chemical compositions of stars encode those of the gas from which they formed, providing important clues regarding the formation histories of galaxies. A powerful diagnostic is the abundance of α elements (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Ti) relative to iron, [α/Fe]. The α elements are synthesized and injected into the interstellar medium by type II supernovae, which occur about ten million years after their originating stars form; by contrast, iron is returned to the interstellar medium by type Ia supernovae, which occur after a much longer timescale of roughly one billion years1. Periods of rapid star formation therefore tend to produce high-[α/Fe] stellar populations (because only type II supernovae have time to contribute to interstellar-medium enrichment as the stellar population forms), whereas low-[α/Fe] stars require periods of star formation that last more than a few billion years (over which timescales type Ia supernovae begin to affect the elemental composition of the interstellar medium more strongly than type II supernovae). The existence of two distinct groups of stars in the solar neighbourhood2-7, one with high [α/Fe] and the other with low [α/Fe], therefore suggests two different origins, but the mechanism by which this bimodal distribution arose remains unknown. Here we use a model of disk-galaxy evolution to show that the two episodes of star formation8 predicted by the `cold flow' theory of galactic gas accretion9,10 also explain the observed chemical bimodality. In this scenario, the high-[α/Fe] stars form early, during an initial phase of accretion that involves infalling streams of cold primordial gas. There is then a hiatus of around two billion years until the shock-heated gas in the galactic dark-matter halo has cooled as a result of radiation and can itself commence accretion. The low-[α/Fe] stars form during this second phase. The peaks in these two star-formation episodes are separated by around five billion years. In addition, the large-scale variation in the abundance patterns of these two stellar populations that has been observed for the Milky Way5,7 is partially explained by the spatial variation in this gas-accretion history.},

	abstract = {We study the evolution of Milky Way thick and thin discs in the light of the most recent observational data. In particular, we analyse abundance gradients of O, N, Fe, and Mg along the thin disc as well as the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relations and the metallicity distribution functions at different Galactocentric distances. We run several models starting from the two-infall paradigm, assuming that the thick and thin discs formed by means of two different infall episodes, and we explore several physical parameters, such as radial gas flows, variable efficiency of star formation, different times for the maximum infall on to the disc, different distributions of the total surface mass density of the thick disc, and enriched gas infall. Our best model suggests that radial gas flows and variable efficiency of star formation should be acting together with the inside-out mechanism for the thin disc formation. The time-scale for maximum infall on to the thin disc, which determines the gap between the formation of the two discs, should be tmax ≃ 3.25 Gyr. The thick disc should have an exponential, small-scale length density profile and gas infall on the inner thin disc should be enriched. We also compute the evolution of Gaia-Enceladus system and study the effects of possible interactions with the thick and thin discs. We conclude that the gas lost by Enceladus or even part of it could have been responsible for the formation of the thick disc but not the thin disc.},

	abstract = {Context. Galactic disc chemical evolution models generally ignore azimuthal surface density variation that can introduce chemical abundance azimuthal gradients. Recent observations, however, have revealed chemical abundance changes with azimuth in the gas and stellar components of both the Milky Way and external galaxies. Aims: Our aim is to quantify the effects of spiral arm density fluctuations on the azimuthal variations of the oxygen and iron abundances in disc galaxies. Methods: We developed a new 2D Galactic disc chemical evolution model that is capable of following not just radial but also azimuthal inhomogeneities. Results: The density fluctuations resulting from a Milky Way-like N-body disc formation simulation produce azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance gradients of the order of 0.1 dex. Moreover, the azimuthal variations are more evident in the outer Galactic regions, which is in agreement with the most recent observations in external galaxies. Using a simple analytical model, we show that the largest fluctuations with azimuth result near the spiral structure co-rotation resonance where the relative speed between the spiral and gaseous disc is the slowest. Conclusion. We provide a new 2D chemical evolution model capable of following azimuthal density variations. Density fluctuations extracted from a Milky Way-like dynamical model lead to a scatter in the azimuthal variations of the oxygen abundance gradient, which is in agreement with observations in external galaxies. We interpret the presence of azimuthal scatter at all radii by the presence of multiple spiral modes moving at different pattern speeds, as found in both observations and numerical simulations.},

It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied using the full distribution of stars from faint dwarfs to supergiants. The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L⋆) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated “green valley” region of the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress.

	abstract = {In recent papers, Mannucci et al. and Mannucci, Della Valle \& Panagia suggested, on the basis of observational arguments, that there is a bimodal distribution of delay times for the explosion of Type Ia supernovae (SNe). In particular, a percentage from 35 to 50 per cent of the total Type Ia SNe should be composed by systems with lifetimes as short as 108 yr, whereas the rest should arise from smaller mass progenitors with a much broader distribution of lifetimes. In this paper, we test this hypothesis in models of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type: ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. We show that this proposed scenario is compatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. In this new formulation, we simply assume that Type Ia SNe are originating from C-O white dwarfs in binary systems without specifying if the progenitor model is the single-degenerate or the double-degenerate one or a mixture of both. In the framework of the single-degenerate model, such a bimodal distribution of the time delays could be explained if the binary systems with a unitary mass ratio are favoured in the mass range 5-8 Msolar, whereas for masses {\textless}5Msolar the favoured systems should have the mass of the primary much larger than the mass of the secondary. When the new rate is introduced in the two-infall model for the Milky Way, the derived Type Ia SN rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at very early epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo more than in the previous widely adopted formulations for the SN Ia rate. As a consequence of this, the [O/Fe] ratio decreases faster for [Fe/H] {\textgreater} -2.0 dex, relative to the old models. For a typical elliptical of 1011Msolar of luminous mass, the new rate produces average [α/Fe] ratios in the dominant stellar population still in agreement with observations. The Type Ia SN rate also in this case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to the previous results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of our Galaxy. We have also checked the effects of the new Type Ia SN rate on the evolution of the Fe content in the intracluster medium (ICM), as a consequence of its production from cluster ellipticals and we found that less Fe in the ICM is produced with the new rate, due to the higher fraction of Fe synthesized at early times and remaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. For dwarf irregular galaxies suffering few bursts of star formation, we obtain [O/Fe] ratios larger by 0.2 dex relative to the previous models.},

	abstract = {We develop a hybrid model of galactic chemical evolution that combines a multiring computation of chemical enrichment with a prescription for stellar migration and the vertical distribution of stellar populations informed by a cosmological hydrodynamic disc galaxy simulation. Our fiducial model adopts empirically motivated forms of the star formation law and star formation history, with a gradient in outflow mass loading tuned to reproduce the observed metallicity gradient. With this approach, the model reproduces many of the striking qualitative features of the Milky Way disc's abundance structure: (i) the dependence of the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution on radius Rgal and mid-plane distance {\textbar}z{\textbar}; (ii) the changing shapes of the [O/H] and [Fe/H] distributions with Rgal and {\textbar}z{\textbar}; (iii) a broad distribution of [O/Fe] at sub-solar metallicity and changes in the [O/Fe] distribution with Rgal, {\textbar}z{\textbar}, and [Fe/H]; (iv) a tight correlation between [O/Fe] and stellar age for [O/Fe] {\textgreater} 0.1; (v) a population of young and intermediate-age α-enhanced stars caused by migration-induced variability in the Type Ia supernova rate; (vi) non-monotonic age-[O/H] and age-[Fe/H] relations, with large scatter and a median age of {\textasciitilde}4 Gyr near solar metallicity. Observationally motivated models with an enhanced star formation rate {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago improve agreement with the observed age-[Fe/H] and age-[O/H] relations, but worsen agreement with the observed age-[O/Fe] relation. None of our models predict an [O/Fe] distribution with the distinct bimodality seen in the observations, suggesting that more dramatic evolutionary pathways are required. All code and tables used for our models are publicly available through the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE; https://pypi.org/project/vice).},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ power law.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia},

	abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (GBP − GRP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, GBP, and GRP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, GBP, and GRP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

	abstract = {The spectral analysis and data products in Data Release 16 (DR16; 2019 December) from the high-resolution near-infrared Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)-2/Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-IV survey are described. Compared to the previous APOGEE data release (DR14; 2017 July), APOGEE DR16 includes about 200,000 new stellar spectra, of which 100,000 are from a new southern APOGEE instrument mounted on the 2.5 m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. DR16 includes all data taken up to 2018 August, including data released in previous data releases. All of the data have been re-reduced and re-analyzed using the latest pipelines, resulting in a total of 473,307 spectra of 437,445 stars. Changes to the analysis methods for this release include, but are not limited to, the use of MARCS model atmospheres for calculation of the entire main grid of synthetic spectra used in the analysis, a new method for filling "holes" in the grids due to unconverged model atmospheres, and a new scheme for continuum normalization. Abundances of the neutron-capture element Ce are included for the first time. A new scheme for estimating uncertainties of the derived quantities using stars with multiple observations has been applied, and calibrated values of surface gravities for dwarf stars are now supplied. Compared to DR14, the radial velocities derived for this release more closely match those in the Gaia DR2 database, and a clear improvement in the spectral analysis of the coolest giants can be seen. The reduced spectra as well as the result of the analysis can be downloaded using links provided on the SDSS DR16 web page.},

For over 150,000 predominantly red giant branch stars that APOGEE targeted across the Galactic bulge, disks and halo, the collected high signal-to-noise ratio ({\textgreater}100 per half-resolution element) spectra provide accurate (∼0.1 km s-1) RVs, stellar atmospheric parameters, and precise (≲0.1 dex) chemical abundances for about 15 chemical species. Here we describe the basic APOGEE data reduction software that reduces multiple 3D raw data cubes into calibrated, well-sampled, combined 1D spectra, as implemented for the SDSS-III/APOGEE data releases (DR10, DR11 and DR12). The processing of the near-IR spectral data of APOGEE presents some challenges for reduction, including automated sky subtraction and telluric correction over a 3°-diameter field and the combination of spectrally dithered spectra. We also discuss areas for future improvement.},

The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chrétien design with a 2.5 m, f/2.25 primary, a 1.08 m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3° diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 Å) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

	abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has built the largest moderately high-resolution (R ≈ 22,500) spectroscopic map of the stars across the Milky Way, and including dust-obscured areas. The APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software developed for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra by comparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using χ2 minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of a fortran90 code that does the actual minimization and a wrapper IDL code for book-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP components and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests designed to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2\%, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants. It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels of precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000 stars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.},

We describe the survey data products that are publicly available, which include catalogs with radial velocity, stellar parameters, and 15 elemental abundances for over 150,000 stars, as well as the more than 500,000 spectra from which these quantities are derived. Calibration relations for the stellar parameters (\{T\}\{eff\}, \{log\} g, [M/H], [α/M]) and abundances (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) are presented and discussed. The internal scatter of the abundances within clusters indicates that abundance precision is generally between 0.05 and 0.09 dex across a broad temperature range; it is smaller for some elemental abundances within more limited ranges and at high signal-to-noise ratio. We assess the accuracy of the abundances using comparison of mean cluster metallicities with literature values, APOGEE observations of the solar spectrum and of Arcturus, comparison of individual star abundances with other measurements, and consideration of the locus of derived parameters and abundances of the entire sample, and find that it is challenging to determine the absolute abundance scale; external accuracy may be good to 0.1-0.2 dex. Uncertainties may be larger at cooler temperatures (\{T\}\{eff\} 4000 \{\{K\}\}).

APOGEE is a survey of ∼105 red giant stars that systematically sampled all Milky Way populations (bulge, disk, and halo) to study the Galaxy’s chemical and kinematical history. It was part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) from 2011 to 2014 using the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico. The APOGEE-2 survey is now using the spectrograph as part of SDSS-IV, as well as a second spectrograph, a close copy of the first, operating at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Although several fiber-fed, multi-object, high resolution spectrographs have been built for visual wavelength spectroscopy, the APOGEE spectrograph is one of the first such instruments built for observations in the near-infrared. The instrument’s successful development was enabled by several key innovations, including a “gang connector” to allow simultaneous connections of 300 fibers; hermetically sealed feedthroughs to allow fibers to pass through the cryostat wall continuously; the first cryogenically deployed mosaic volume phase holographic grating; and a large refractive camera that includes mono-crystalline silicon and fused silica elements with diameters as large as ∼400 mm. This paper contains a comprehensive description of all aspects of the instrument including the fiber system, optics and opto-mechanics, detector arrays, mechanics and cryogenics, instrument control, calibration system, optical performance and stability, lessons learned, and design changes for the second instrument.},

An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species. As part of SDSS-III Data Release 12 and later releases, all of the APOGEE data products are publicly available.},

	abstract = {This paper documents the seventeenth data release (DR17) from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys; the fifth and final release from the fourth phase (SDSS-IV). DR17 contains the complete release of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, which reached its goal of surveying over 10,000 nearby galaxies. The complete release of the MaNGA Stellar Library accompanies this data, providing observations of almost 30,000 stars through the MaNGA instrument during bright time. DR17 also contains the complete release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 survey that publicly releases infrared spectra of over 650,000 stars. The main sample from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), as well as the subsurvey Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey data were fully released in DR16. New single-fiber optical spectroscopy released in DR17 is from the SPectroscipic IDentification of ERosita Survey subsurvey and the eBOSS-RM program. Along with the primary data sets, DR17 includes 25 new or updated value-added catalogs. This paper concludes the release of SDSS-IV survey data. SDSS continues into its fifth phase with observations already underway for the Milky Way Mapper, Local Volume Mapper, and Black Hole Mapper surveys.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2304.00042},
	abstract = {Context: In the last years, a significant number of works have focused on finding analytic solutions for the chemical enrichment models of galactic systems, including the Milky Way. Some of these solutions, however, cannot account for the enrichment produced by Type Ia SNe due to the presence of the delay time distributions (DTDs) in the models. Aims: We present a new analytic solution for the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy. This solution can be used with different prescriptions of the DTD, including the single and double degenerate scenarios, and allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of pristine gas infalls. Methods: We integrate the chemical evolution model by extending the instantaneous recycling approximation with the contribution of Type Ia SNe. For those DTDs that lead to non-analytic integrals, we describe them as a superposition of Gaussian, exponential and 1/t functions using a restricted least-squares fitting method. Results: We obtain the exact solution for a chemical model with Type Ia SNe widely used in previous works. This solution can reproduce the expected chemical evolution of the alpha and iron-peak elements in less computing time than numerical integration methods. We compare the pattern in the [Si/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane observed by APOGEE DR17 with that predicted by the model. We find the low alpha sequence can be explained by a delayed gas infall. We exploit the applicability of our solution by modelling the chemical evolution of a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy from its star formation history. The implementation of our solution is released as a python package. Conclusions: Our solution constitutes a promising tool for the Galactic Archaeology and is able to model the observed trends in alpha element abundances versus [Fe/H] in the solar neighbourhood. We infer the chemical information of a simulated galaxy modelled without Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Context. Precise stellar ages from asteroseismology have become available and can help to set stronger constraints on the evolution of the Galactic disc components. Recently, asteroseismology has confirmed a clear age difference in the solar annulus between two distinct sequences in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratios relation: the high-α and low-α stellar populations. Aims: We aim to reproduce these new data with chemical evolution models including different assumptions for the history and number of accretion events. Methods: We tested two different approaches: a revised version of the "two-infall" model where the high-α phase forms by a fast gas accretion episode and the low-α sequence follows later from a slower gas infall rate, and the parallel formation scenario where the two disc sequences form coevally and independently. Results: The revised two-infall model including uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic epochs, ii) the age-metallicity relation and the time evolution [α/Fe]; iii) the age distribution of the high-α and low-α stellar populations, iv) the metallicity distribution function. The parallel approach is not capable of properly reproducing the stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. Conclusions: The best chemical evolution model is the revised two-infall one, where a consistent delay of ∼4.3 Gyr in the beginning of the second gas accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar abundances and ages.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of bursts in star formation on the predictions of one-zone chemical evolution models, adopting oxygen (O), iron (Fe), and strontium (Sr), as representative α, iron-peak, and s-process elements, respectively. To this end, we develop and make use of the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE), a PYTHON package designed to handle flexible user-specified evolutionary parameters. Starbursts driven by a temporary boost of gas accretion rate create loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolutionary tracks and a peak in the stellar [O/Fe] distribution at intermediate values. Bursts driven by a temporary boost of star formation efficiency have similar effects, and they also produce a population of α-deficient stars during the depressed star formation phase following the burst. This α-deficient population is more prominent if the outflow rate is tied to a time-averaged star formation rate (SFR) instead of the instantaneous SFR. Theoretical models of Sr production predict a strong metallicity dependence of supernova and asymptotic giant branch star yields, though comparison to data suggests an additional, nearly metallicity-independent source. Evolution of [Sr/Fe] and [Sr/O] during a starburst is complex because of this metallicity dependence and the multiple time-scales at play. Moderate amplitude (10-20 per cent) sinusoidal oscillations in SFR produce loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks and multiple peaks in [O/Fe] distributions, a potential source of intrinsic scatter in observed sequences. We investigate the impact of a factor {\textasciitilde}2 enhancement of Galactic star formation {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago, as suggested by some recent observations. VICE is publicly available at .},
