It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied using the full distribution of stars from faint dwarfs to supergiants. The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L⋆) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated “green valley” region of the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations.},

	abstract = {In recent papers, Mannucci et al. and Mannucci, Della Valle \& Panagia suggested, on the basis of observational arguments, that there is a bimodal distribution of delay times for the explosion of Type Ia supernovae (SNe). In particular, a percentage from 35 to 50 per cent of the total Type Ia SNe should be composed by systems with lifetimes as short as 108 yr, whereas the rest should arise from smaller mass progenitors with a much broader distribution of lifetimes. In this paper, we test this hypothesis in models of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type: ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. We show that this proposed scenario is compatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. In this new formulation, we simply assume that Type Ia SNe are originating from C-O white dwarfs in binary systems without specifying if the progenitor model is the single-degenerate or the double-degenerate one or a mixture of both. In the framework of the single-degenerate model, such a bimodal distribution of the time delays could be explained if the binary systems with a unitary mass ratio are favoured in the mass range 5-8 Msolar, whereas for masses {\textless}5Msolar the favoured systems should have the mass of the primary much larger than the mass of the secondary. When the new rate is introduced in the two-infall model for the Milky Way, the derived Type Ia SN rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at very early epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo more than in the previous widely adopted formulations for the SN Ia rate. As a consequence of this, the [O/Fe] ratio decreases faster for [Fe/H] {\textgreater} -2.0 dex, relative to the old models. For a typical elliptical of 1011Msolar of luminous mass, the new rate produces average [α/Fe] ratios in the dominant stellar population still in agreement with observations. The Type Ia SN rate also in this case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to the previous results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of our Galaxy. We have also checked the effects of the new Type Ia SN rate on the evolution of the Fe content in the intracluster medium (ICM), as a consequence of its production from cluster ellipticals and we found that less Fe in the ICM is produced with the new rate, due to the higher fraction of Fe synthesized at early times and remaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. For dwarf irregular galaxies suffering few bursts of star formation, we obtain [O/Fe] ratios larger by 0.2 dex relative to the previous models.},

	abstract = {We develop a hybrid model of galactic chemical evolution that combines a multiring computation of chemical enrichment with a prescription for stellar migration and the vertical distribution of stellar populations informed by a cosmological hydrodynamic disc galaxy simulation. Our fiducial model adopts empirically motivated forms of the star formation law and star formation history, with a gradient in outflow mass loading tuned to reproduce the observed metallicity gradient. With this approach, the model reproduces many of the striking qualitative features of the Milky Way disc's abundance structure: (i) the dependence of the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution on radius Rgal and mid-plane distance {\textbar}z{\textbar}; (ii) the changing shapes of the [O/H] and [Fe/H] distributions with Rgal and {\textbar}z{\textbar}; (iii) a broad distribution of [O/Fe] at sub-solar metallicity and changes in the [O/Fe] distribution with Rgal, {\textbar}z{\textbar}, and [Fe/H]; (iv) a tight correlation between [O/Fe] and stellar age for [O/Fe] {\textgreater} 0.1; (v) a population of young and intermediate-age α-enhanced stars caused by migration-induced variability in the Type Ia supernova rate; (vi) non-monotonic age-[O/H] and age-[Fe/H] relations, with large scatter and a median age of {\textasciitilde}4 Gyr near solar metallicity. Observationally motivated models with an enhanced star formation rate {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago improve agreement with the observed age-[Fe/H] and age-[O/H] relations, but worsen agreement with the observed age-[O/Fe] relation. None of our models predict an [O/Fe] distribution with the distinct bimodality seen in the observations, suggesting that more dramatic evolutionary pathways are required. All code and tables used for our models are publicly available through the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE; https://pypi.org/project/vice).},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ power law.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia},

	abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (GBP − GRP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, GBP, and GRP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, GBP, and GRP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

	abstract = {The spectral analysis and data products in Data Release 16 (DR16; 2019 December) from the high-resolution near-infrared Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)-2/Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-IV survey are described. Compared to the previous APOGEE data release (DR14; 2017 July), APOGEE DR16 includes about 200,000 new stellar spectra, of which 100,000 are from a new southern APOGEE instrument mounted on the 2.5 m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. DR16 includes all data taken up to 2018 August, including data released in previous data releases. All of the data have been re-reduced and re-analyzed using the latest pipelines, resulting in a total of 473,307 spectra of 437,445 stars. Changes to the analysis methods for this release include, but are not limited to, the use of MARCS model atmospheres for calculation of the entire main grid of synthetic spectra used in the analysis, a new method for filling "holes" in the grids due to unconverged model atmospheres, and a new scheme for continuum normalization. Abundances of the neutron-capture element Ce are included for the first time. A new scheme for estimating uncertainties of the derived quantities using stars with multiple observations has been applied, and calibrated values of surface gravities for dwarf stars are now supplied. Compared to DR14, the radial velocities derived for this release more closely match those in the Gaia DR2 database, and a clear improvement in the spectral analysis of the coolest giants can be seen. The reduced spectra as well as the result of the analysis can be downloaded using links provided on the SDSS DR16 web page.},

For over 150,000 predominantly red giant branch stars that APOGEE targeted across the Galactic bulge, disks and halo, the collected high signal-to-noise ratio ({\textgreater}100 per half-resolution element) spectra provide accurate (∼0.1 km s-1) RVs, stellar atmospheric parameters, and precise (≲0.1 dex) chemical abundances for about 15 chemical species. Here we describe the basic APOGEE data reduction software that reduces multiple 3D raw data cubes into calibrated, well-sampled, combined 1D spectra, as implemented for the SDSS-III/APOGEE data releases (DR10, DR11 and DR12). The processing of the near-IR spectral data of APOGEE presents some challenges for reduction, including automated sky subtraction and telluric correction over a 3°-diameter field and the combination of spectrally dithered spectra. We also discuss areas for future improvement.},

The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chrétien design with a 2.5 m, f/2.25 primary, a 1.08 m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3° diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 Å) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

	abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has built the largest moderately high-resolution (R ≈ 22,500) spectroscopic map of the stars across the Milky Way, and including dust-obscured areas. The APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software developed for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra by comparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using χ2 minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of a fortran90 code that does the actual minimization and a wrapper IDL code for book-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP components and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests designed to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2\%, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants. It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels of precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000 stars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.},

We describe the survey data products that are publicly available, which include catalogs with radial velocity, stellar parameters, and 15 elemental abundances for over 150,000 stars, as well as the more than 500,000 spectra from which these quantities are derived. Calibration relations for the stellar parameters (\{T\}\{eff\}, \{log\} g, [M/H], [α/M]) and abundances (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) are presented and discussed. The internal scatter of the abundances within clusters indicates that abundance precision is generally between 0.05 and 0.09 dex across a broad temperature range; it is smaller for some elemental abundances within more limited ranges and at high signal-to-noise ratio. We assess the accuracy of the abundances using comparison of mean cluster metallicities with literature values, APOGEE observations of the solar spectrum and of Arcturus, comparison of individual star abundances with other measurements, and consideration of the locus of derived parameters and abundances of the entire sample, and find that it is challenging to determine the absolute abundance scale; external accuracy may be good to 0.1-0.2 dex. Uncertainties may be larger at cooler temperatures (\{T\}\{eff\} 4000 \{\{K\}\}).

APOGEE is a survey of ∼105 red giant stars that systematically sampled all Milky Way populations (bulge, disk, and halo) to study the Galaxy’s chemical and kinematical history. It was part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) from 2011 to 2014 using the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico. The APOGEE-2 survey is now using the spectrograph as part of SDSS-IV, as well as a second spectrograph, a close copy of the first, operating at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Although several fiber-fed, multi-object, high resolution spectrographs have been built for visual wavelength spectroscopy, the APOGEE spectrograph is one of the first such instruments built for observations in the near-infrared. The instrument’s successful development was enabled by several key innovations, including a “gang connector” to allow simultaneous connections of 300 fibers; hermetically sealed feedthroughs to allow fibers to pass through the cryostat wall continuously; the first cryogenically deployed mosaic volume phase holographic grating; and a large refractive camera that includes mono-crystalline silicon and fused silica elements with diameters as large as ∼400 mm. This paper contains a comprehensive description of all aspects of the instrument including the fiber system, optics and opto-mechanics, detector arrays, mechanics and cryogenics, instrument control, calibration system, optical performance and stability, lessons learned, and design changes for the second instrument.},

	abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), one of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now completed its systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all major populations of the Milky Way. After a three-year observing campaign on the Sloan 2.5 m Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half million high-resolution (R ∼ 22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio ({\textgreater}100), infrared (1.51-1.70 μm) spectra for 146,000 stars, with time series information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper describes the motivations for the survey and its overall design—hardware, field placement, target selection, operations—and gives an overview of these aspects as well as the data reduction, analysis, and products. An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species.

DR17 contains the complete release of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, which reached its goal of surveying over 10,000 nearby galaxies. The complete release of the MaNGA Stellar Library accompanies this data, providing observations of almost 30,000 stars through the MaNGA instrument during bright time. DR17 also contains the complete release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 survey that publicly releases infrared spectra of over 650,000 stars. The main sample from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), as well as the subsurvey Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey data were fully released in DR16. New single-fiber optical spectroscopy released in DR17 is from the SPectroscipic IDentification of ERosita Survey subsurvey and the eBOSS-RM program. Along with the primary data sets, DR17 includes 25 new or updated value-added catalogs. This paper concludes the release of SDSS-IV survey data. SDSS continues into its fifth phase with observations already underway for the Milky Way Mapper, Local Volume Mapper, and Black Hole Mapper surveys.},

	abstract = {Constraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy require multi-dimensional measurements of kinematics, abundances, and ages for a large population of stars. Ages for luminous giants, which can be seen to large distances, are an essential component of studies of the Milky Way, but they are traditionally very difficult to estimate precisely for a large dataset and often require careful analysis on a star-by-star basis in asteroseismology. Because spectra are easier to obtain for large samples, being able to determine precise ages from spectra allows for large age samples to be constructed, but spectroscopic ages are often imprecise and contaminated by abundance correlations. Here we present an application of a variational encoder-decoder on cross-domain astronomical data to solve these issues. The model is trained on pairs of stars observed by APOGEE and Kepler in order to reduce the dimensionality of the APOGEE spectra in a latent space while removing abundance information. The low dimensional latent representation of these spectra can then be trained to predict age with just \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1,000 precise seismic ages. We demonstrate that this model produces more precise spectroscopic ages (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 22\% overall, \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 11\% for red-clump stars) than previous data-driven spectroscopic ages while being less contaminated by abundance information (in particular, our ages do not depend on [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/M]). We create a public age catalog for the APOGEE DR17 data set and use it to map the age distribution and the age-[Fe/H]-[\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/M] distribution across the radial range of the Galactic disk.},

	abstract = {Aims: Our aim is to show how different hypotheses about type Ia supernova progenitors can affect Galactic chemical evolution. Supernovae Ia are believed to be the main producers of Fe and the timescale with which Fe is restored into the interstellar medium depends on the assumed supernova progenitor model. This is a way of selecting the most appropriate progenitor model for supernovae Ia, a still debated issue. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We include different type Ia SN progenitor models, identified by their distribution of time delays, in a very detailed chemical evolution model for the Milky Way which follows the evolution of several chemical species. We test the single degenerate and the double degenerate models for supernova Ia progenitors, as well as other more empirical models based on differences in the time delay distributions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We find that assuming the single degenerate or the double degenerate scenario produces negligible differences in the predicted [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation. On the other hand, assuming a percentage of prompt (exploding in the first 100 Myr) type Ia supernovae of 50\%, or that the maximum type Ia rate is reached after 3-4 Gyr from the beginning of star formation, as suggested by several authors, produces more noticeable effects on the [O/Fe] trend. However, given the spread still existing in the observational data, no model can be firmly excluded on the basis of only the [O/Fe] ratios. On the other hand, when the predictions of the different models are compared with the G-dwarf metallicity distribution, the scenarios with very few prompt type Ia supernovae can be excluded. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: Models including the single degenerate or double degenerate scenario with a percentage of 10-13\% of prompt type Ia supernovae produce results in very good agreement with the observations. A fraction of prompt type Ia supernovae larger than 30\% worsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no prompt type Ia supernovae are allowed. In particular, two empirical models for the type Ia SN progenitors can be excluded: the one without prompt type Ia supernovae and the one assuming a delay time distribution that is ∝t{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-0.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We conclude that the typical timescale for the Fe enrichment in the Milky Way is around 1-1.5 Gyr and that type Ia supernovae already should appear during the halo phase.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2304.00042},
	abstract = {Context: In the last years, a significant number of works have focused on finding analytic solutions for the chemical enrichment models of galactic systems, including the Milky Way. Some of these solutions, however, cannot account for the enrichment produced by Type Ia SNe due to the presence of the delay time distributions (DTDs) in the models. Aims: We present a new analytic solution for the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy. This solution can be used with different prescriptions of the DTD, including the single and double degenerate scenarios, and allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of pristine gas infalls. Methods: We integrate the chemical evolution model by extending the instantaneous recycling approximation with the contribution of Type Ia SNe. For those DTDs that lead to non-analytic integrals, we describe them as a superposition of Gaussian, exponential and 1/t functions using a restricted least-squares fitting method. Results: We obtain the exact solution for a chemical model with Type Ia SNe widely used in previous works. This solution can reproduce the expected chemical evolution of the alpha and iron-peak elements in less computing time than numerical integration methods. We compare the pattern in the [Si/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane observed by APOGEE DR17 with that predicted by the model. We find the low alpha sequence can be explained by a delayed gas infall. We exploit the applicability of our solution by modelling the chemical evolution of a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy from its star formation history. The implementation of our solution is released as a python package. Conclusions: Our solution constitutes a promising tool for the Galactic Archaeology and is able to model the observed trends in alpha element abundances versus [Fe/H] in the solar neighbourhood. We infer the chemical information of a simulated galaxy modelled without Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The recent Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) represents an unparalleled revolution in Galactic Archaeology, providing us with numerous radial velocities chemical abundances for million of stars, overcoming the spatial biases that ground-based spectroscopic surveys suffer from ground-based surveys. We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galactic disc components (high- and low- \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence stars) designed to reproduce the new abundance ratios provided by the GSP-spec module for the Gaia DR3 and also constrained by i) stellar ages and ii) detailed star formation histories for both the thick and thin disc stars inferred from previous Gaia releases. Gaia DR3 highlighted the presence of young (massive) low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ disc stars which show evidence of a recent chemical impoverishment in several elements. Additionally, previous Gaia releases have found evidence for narrow episodes of enhanced SF inferred in recent time. In order to reproduce these observables, we propose a new chemical evolution model in which the low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence is generated by two distinct infall episodes. Hence, in this study we compare Gaia DR3 chemical abundances with the predictions of a three-infall chemical evolution model for the high- and low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ components. The proposed three-infall chemical evolution model nicely reproduces the main features of the abundance ratio [X/Fe] versus [M/H] (X=Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, \${\textbackslash}alpha\$) of Gaia DR3 stars in different age bins for the considered \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ elements. Moreover, the most recent gas infall - which started \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 2.7 Gyr ago - allows us to predict well the Gaia DR3 young population which has experienced a recent chemical impoverishment.},

The analysis of the latest release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment project (APOGEE DR16) data suggests the existence of a clear distinction between two sequences of disc stars at different Galactocentric distances in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratio space: the so-called high-α sequence, classically associated with an old population of stars in the thick disc with high average [α/Fe], and the low-α sequence, which mostly comprises relatively young stars in the thin disc with low average [α/Fe]. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to constrain a multi-zone two-infall chemical evolution model designed for regions at different Galactocentric distances using measured chemical abundances from the APOGEE DR16 sample. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We performed a Bayesian analysis based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to fit our multi-zone two-infall chemical evolution model to the APOGEE DR16 data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: An inside-out formation of the Galaxy disc naturally emerges from the best fit of our two-infall chemical-evolution model to APOGEE-DR16: Inner Galactic regions are assembled on shorter timescales compared to the external ones. In the outer disc (with radii R \&gt; 6 kpc), the chemical dilution due to a late accretion event of gas with a primordial chemical composition is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance pattern in the low-α sequence. In the inner disc, in the framework of the two-infall model, we confirm the presence of an enriched gas infall in the low-α phase as suggested by chemo-dynamical models. Our Bayesian analysis of the recent APOGEE DR16 data suggests a significant delay time, ranging from ∼3.0 to 4.7 Gyr, between the first and second gas infall events for all the analysed Galactocentric regions. The best fit model reproduces several observational constraints such as: (i) the present-day stellar and gas surface density profiles; (ii) the present-day abundance gradients; (iii) the star formation rate profile; and (iv) the solar abundance values. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results propose a clear interpretation of the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relations along the Galactic discs. The signatures of a delayed gas-rich merger which gives rise to a hiatus in the star formation history of the Galaxy are impressed in the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation, determining how the low-α stars are distributed in the abundance space at different Galactocentric distances, which is in agreement with the finding of recent chemo-dynamical simulations.},

With the wealth of information from large surveys and observational campaigns in the contemporary era, it is critical to properly exploit the data to constrain the parameters of Galactic chemical evolution models and quantify the associated uncertainties. Aims: We aim to constrain the two-infall chemical evolution models for the solar annulus using the measured chemical abundance ratios and seismically inferred age of stars in the APOKASC sample. Recently, in revised two-infall chemical evolution models, a significant delay of ∼4.3 Gyr has been invoked between the two episodes of gas accretion. In this work, we wish to test its robustness and statistically confirm and quantify the delay. Methods: We took a novel approach, using Bayesian framework based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit the two-infall chemical evolution models to the data. Results: In addition to fitting the data for stars in the APOKASC sample, our best fit models also reproduce other important observational constraints of the chemical evolution of the disk: i) present day stellar surface density; ii) present-day supernova and star formation rates; iii) the metallicity distribution function; and iv) solar abundance values. We find a significant delay between the two gas accretion episodes for various models explored with different values for the star formation efficiencies. The values for the delay lie in the range 4.5-5.5 Gyr. Conclusions: The results suggest that the APOKASC sample carries the signature of a delayed gas-rich merger, with dilution being the main process determining the shape of low-α stars in the abundance ratios space.},

Recently, asteroseismology has confirmed a clear age difference in the solar annulus between two distinct sequences in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratios relation: the high-α and low-α stellar populations. Aims: We aim to reproduce these new data with chemical evolution models including different assumptions for the history and number of accretion events. Methods: We tested two different approaches: a revised version of the "two-infall" model where the high-α phase forms by a fast gas accretion episode and the low-α sequence follows later from a slower gas infall rate, and the parallel formation scenario where the two disc sequences form coevally and independently. Results: The revised two-infall model including uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic epochs, ii) the age-metallicity relation and the time evolution [α/Fe]; iii) the age distribution of the high-α and low-α stellar populations, iv) the metallicity distribution function. The parallel approach is not capable of properly reproducing the stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. Conclusions: The best chemical evolution model is the revised two-infall one, where a consistent delay of ∼4.3 Gyr in the beginning of the second gas accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar abundances and ages.},

	abstract = {We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes two main infall episodes, for the formation of the halo-thick disk and thin disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available. Our model fits these new data very well. The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that, in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of {\textless}=1 Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation in the solar vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of the disk (R {\textless} 1 R⊙) are steeper than in the outer regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of the star formation process are discussed.},

To this end, we develop and make use of the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE), a PYTHON package designed to handle flexible user-specified evolutionary parameters. Starbursts driven by a temporary boost of gas accretion rate create loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolutionary tracks and a peak in the stellar [O/Fe] distribution at intermediate values. Bursts driven by a temporary boost of star formation efficiency have similar effects, and they also produce a population of α-deficient stars during the depressed star formation phase following the burst. This α-deficient population is more prominent if the outflow rate is tied to a time-averaged star formation rate (SFR) instead of the instantaneous SFR. Theoretical models of Sr production predict a strong metallicity dependence of supernova and asymptotic giant branch star yields, though comparison to data suggests an additional, nearly metallicity-independent source. Evolution of [Sr/Fe] and [Sr/O] during a starburst is complex because of this metallicity dependence and the multiple time-scales at play. Moderate amplitude (10-20 per cent) sinusoidal oscillations in SFR produce loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks and multiple peaks in [O/Fe] distributions, a potential source of intrinsic scatter in observed sequences. We investigate the impact of a factor {\textasciitilde}2 enhancement of Galactic star formation {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago, as suggested by some recent observations. VICE is publicly available at .},
