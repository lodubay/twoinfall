	abstract = {We investigate the impact of bursts in star formation on the predictions of one-zone chemical evolution models, adopting oxygen (O), iron (Fe), and strontium (Sr), as representative α, iron-peak, and s-process elements, respectively. To this end, we develop and make use of the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE), a PYTHON package designed to handle flexible user-specified evolutionary parameters. Starbursts driven by a temporary boost of gas accretion rate create loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolutionary tracks and a peak in the stellar [O/Fe] distribution at intermediate values. Bursts driven by a temporary boost of star formation efficiency have similar effects, and they also produce a population of α-deficient stars during the depressed star formation phase following the burst. This α-deficient population is more prominent if the outflow rate is tied to a time-averaged star formation rate (SFR) instead of the instantaneous SFR. Theoretical models of Sr production predict a strong metallicity dependence of supernova and asymptotic giant branch star yields, though comparison to data suggests an additional, nearly metallicity-independent source. Evolution of [Sr/Fe] and [Sr/O] during a starburst is complex because of this metallicity dependence and the multiple time-scales at play. Moderate amplitude (10-20 per cent) sinusoidal oscillations in SFR produce loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks and multiple peaks in [O/Fe] distributions, a potential source of intrinsic scatter in observed sequences. We investigate the impact of a factor {\textasciitilde}2 enhancement of Galactic star formation {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago, as suggested by some recent observations. VICE is publicly available at .},
